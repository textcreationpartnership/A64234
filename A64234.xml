            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:99901:3"/>and Shelter of the Night, but in the open Day endeavour to blow up the Foundations of our Faith. I have little Hopes of the Recovery of thoſe who are ſo very far gone in Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that they have nothing of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> left them, but what is in one of their <hi>Names;</hi> However ſomewhat may and ought to be done, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe who are not yet infected, and reſtore them who are not too deeply tainted.</p>
            <p>The Poyſon has been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the World by the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Name of <hi>the Oracles of Reaſon;</hi> And there can be no doubt, unleſs it be, becauſe of the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of them, <hi>by whom,</hi> they who have vented them, were inſpired: But the Devil cannot always ſpeak through the <hi>Serpent;</hi> ſometimes he muſt make uſe of a <hi>duller Animal,</hi> the beſt he can get. Thin Cobwebs indeed they are, which theſe venomous Creatures do
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:99901:3"/>weave; but yet they have been ſtrong enough to hold ſome little <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,</hi> corrupting firſt the Minds, and then the Manners, of them that are raw, unskilful, and unſetled. Too many Proſelytes they have gotten, ſuch as they are; And tho' ſome of them evidently do not underſtand the Infidel Cavils and Objections they have read; yet they will in Diſcourſe be <hi>hammering</hi> at them, and repeat ſomewhat of them, like an <hi>Eccho</hi> in an empty and a hollow Place, which reverberates the laſt Words that were ſpoken; tho' in ſuch a broken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect manner, that there is no Senſe to be made of them.</p>

Wicked Men do greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catch at every little Cavil againſt the Scriptures, becauſe it is their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to have them run down; The
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:99901:4"/>Word of God is againſt <hi>them,</hi> and therefore they are againſt <hi>it:</hi> If the Bible be true, they muſt either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Luſts, or be Eternally damned for them; and they cannot bear the Thoughts either of the one or the other. But a Pious Man is freed from this Snare and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and beſides that, he has <hi>the Witneſs within himſelf;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.10.</note> he need but conſult the bleſſed Change that has been made by the Holy Scriptures, in order to his Eſtabliſhment in Chriſtianity. When the <hi>Jews</hi> reviled Chriſt as an Impoſtor, he who had been Blind, anſwered like one, the Eyes of whoſe Underſtanding were opened, as well as thoſe of his Body: <hi>Why,
<note place="margin">Joh. 9.30.</note> herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine Eyes.</hi> 'Tis alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Unaccountable for a Man to give way to Doubts and Fears, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Doctrine be from Heaven,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:99901:4"/>which he finds has fitted his Soul for it.</p>
            <p>Many Good Meen indeed do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily ſuck in ſome untoward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when a little gilded over, which in their Nature tend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Practices. But through the Weakneſs of their Heads they don't diſcern the Evil Nature, or Direct Tendency of them: and through the Honeſty of their Hearts they do not follow whither they would naturally lead 'em. The <hi>Grace</hi> of God within ſerves inſtead of the Gift of <hi>Miracles:</hi> And what our Saviour promis'd his Diſciples as an Extraordinary Favour in the Primitive Times,
<note place="margin">Mar. 16.8.</note> 
               <hi>they ſhall take up Serpents; and if they drink any Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing, it ſhall not hurt them,</hi> hath been in ſome meaſure daily verified in all ſucceeding Ages. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their Conſtitution throws off the Poyſon they have heedleſsly taken down; and tho' they receive
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:99901:5"/>ſome Miſchief, yet the <hi>killing</hi> Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it is ſtrangely prevented by that Sovereign Antidote which they have within 'em.</p>
            <p>And the ſame Good Principle produces a rooted <hi>Antipathy</hi> in them againſt <hi>Fundamental Errors</hi> and <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſies.</hi> All Creatures, Plants as well as Animals, have a natural Inſtinct, whereby they draw to them what is proper for their Preſervation, Growth, and Nouriſhment; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void that which is deſtructive to them. The New Creature, the moſt Excellent of all, is not worſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, than every inferior Being. An enlightened Chriſtian has a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Inſtinct,</hi> which makes him turn aſide from Damnable Errors, and unmovably retain the great Truths of the Goſpel, with a mighty Reliſh and Savour. And this is that which holds the Generality of Chriſtians cloſe to, and keeps them faſt in the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:99901:5"/>Faith, when Deceivers do abound, more than mere <hi>dry Reaſon</hi> and Strength of Argument can poſſibly do. It cannot reaſonably be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that all Holy Men ſhould be able to Anſwer all thoſe Cavils, that may be ſtarted by ſubtile Hereticks, or learned Infidels, againſt our Holy Religion; eſpecially conſidering, there are not among them <hi>many Learned,</hi> many of the <hi>Diſputers of this World:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10.21.</note> But God <hi>hides theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and reveals them unto Babes; even ſo, O Father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy Sight. They went out from us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 2.19.</note> ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, no doubt but they would have continued with us.</hi> But will ſincere Chriſtians follow them? No, that cannot be: For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle adds,
<note place="margin">v. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Ye have an Unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things; and the ſame anointing teacheth you of all
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:99901:6"/>things, and is truth, and is no lie: And even as it hath taught you,
<label type="milestone">

<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.11.</note> 
               <hi>He that eſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God.</hi> And</p>
            <p>As the whole Syſtem of Divine Graces is an excellent Preſervative,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> ſo is that particular Grace of <hi>Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> in an eminent Manner. They who are humble (and he who knows himſelf, will be ſo) will never offer at ſetting up their own ſhort Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings as the Meaſure and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Truth. There are Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Art, in Nature, in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, in Natural Religion; no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then there are ſo in Revealed Religion, and the Holy Scriptures. Two things there are, that make it neceſſary that there ſhould be deep things in <hi>them,</hi> to us unſearchable
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:99901:6"/>and paſt our finding out. They treat of the Nature, Counſels, and Acts of God, which are laid down as the neceſſary Foundations of Practical Holineſs; and We are poor ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted Creatures; as ſoon may a Man contain the whole Ocean in the Hollow of his Hand, as We compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend an Infinite Being, and his Wiſe Counſels and Decrees. That there are Myſteries in Chriſtianity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being a Stone of Stumbling, and a Prejudice againſt our Faith, ſhould rather be a Confirmation of it to us, and an Argument for it; it looks more like a Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when ſome Parts of it are very Profound and Abſtruſe. Revealed Religion, like a Picture, muſt have its dark Shades, as well as its brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Colours. As to its Practical Part, it is, and ought to be, clear: But the Articles that are to be believed, muſt of neceſſity be Obſcure; I ſhould
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:99901:7"/>expect that the Foundation of ſo great a Building ſhould be laid <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ground,</hi> and out of Sight. And a humble Perſon will quickly be convinced, that it is his Duty to bow down his Head before Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as well as ſubmit his Will to the Divine Command; and that a Creature muſt yield Subjection to his Maker with his whole Man, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part thereof. But yet</p>
            <p>It is a good thing,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> that the Head be filled with <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that we may be able to give a Reaſonable Anſwer to them who do ask an Account of our Faith and Hope. And in a time when the Road is full of Thieves, whoſe Deſign it is to Rob and Murder us, no Man ſhould Travel without a <hi>Sword</hi> by his Side; and every Man ſhould get ſome skill to manage his Weapon, that he may at leaſt defend himſelf, and
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:99901:7"/>that Sacred Treaſure which is, or ought to be, dearer to him than his Life. I will therefore briefly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome of thoſe <hi>Rational Grounds,</hi> upon which our Aſſent to the Chriſtian Doctrine ought to be built, and then it will remain firm and unſhaken. They may be reduced to theſe two Heads; The Nature of Chriſtianity; And the Divine Proof of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For the <hi>Nature</hi> of Chriſtianity, 'tis a Religion every way <hi>Worthy of God.</hi> For it gives us ſuch an Account of the Nature and Will of God, as our Reaſon with great Toil poſſibly might have found out, and cannot but approve and cloſe withal as ſoon as ever it is propoſed to us. 'Tis a great Advantage to have this Food brought to our Hands, and not to be obliged to <hi>hunt</hi> after it; for that at the beſt would have coſt us great Labour, and we might have miſſed
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:99901:8"/>of it. And theſe it acquaints us with, not to amuſe and entertain us with ſubtile and uſeleſs Speculations, but as a neceſſary Foundation for the promoting and encouraging our living <hi>Righteouſly, Soberly, and Godly, in this preſent Evil World,</hi> which is the Apparent Deſign of the Goſpel. And in requiring <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> as well as Righteouſneſs and Sobriety, it does vaſtly exceed all the Inſtructions that we can learn from any of the Heathen Philoſophers. They have indeed, the Second Table written in their Books pretty fairly, tho' not without ſome Blots and <hi>Errata</hi>'s: But as for the Firſt Table, they have but a few broken Letters of the Duties of it, and theſe too in a very ſmall Character. The Goſpel migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily inſiſts upon, and preſſes the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Loving God</hi> with our whole Hearts and Souls, of making his <hi>Glory</hi> our Chief End in all that we
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:99901:8"/>do: Doctrines that lie at the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Practical Holineſs; which yet the Heathen Philoſophers never mentioned, nor dream'd of: And one may as ſoon expect to find a <hi>Jewel</hi> by raking in a <hi>Dunghil,</hi> as to meet with any Paſſages of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in any of their Writings.</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis a Religion every way <hi>ſuited to the State of Fallen Man:</hi> For it plainly acquaints us, That we are in a State of Apoſtacy, and how this came about. And it would greatly endear the Holy Scriptures to Men, if they did but Diſtinctly know what a perplexing Inquiry this has been among the greateſt Wits, and the moſt learned Scholars, who have not had the Word of God for their Guide;
<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>how Sin and Miſery came to break into this World.</hi> Some attributed it to Diſcord and Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:99901:9"/>a certain quarrelſome, pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, bloody Principle, which they knew not what to make of; but this is to put us off with mere Words and Sounds. Others, to the neceſſary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Matter. Others; to ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry malignant Spirit, that had ſlily wound it ſelf into it. Others, to <hi>two Gods,</hi> a Good, and a Bad one: And tho' it is impoſſible that more Nonſence and Contradiction ſhould be crowded together in the narrow Compaſs of ſo few Words, <hi>Two Gods, whereof one a wicked, ſpiteful, and malicious One:</hi> Yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, This was <hi>the moſt Ancient Opinion, and moſt Univerſally received among the Wiſeſt of the Heathen.</hi> And

<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:99901:9"/>believe as the Ancient</hi> Perſians <hi>did, That there were TWO Beginnings of things, the one Good, the other Evil: For how can Evil proceed from a Being infinitely good, and without whom nothing is, if Evil be not? And if Dr.</hi> Burnet
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 207.</note> 
               <hi>have proved</hi> Geneſis <hi>but a Parable, why may not the</hi> Perſians <hi>be as much in the right, as the</hi> Jews? And yet another of his Brethren tells us
<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 197.</note>, That this is the firſt Head of the Deiſts Natural Religion; That there is <hi>ONE</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Eternal God, Creator of all things. And in another place, That <hi>the generally acknowledged Lapſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and how it came, may be diſcovered by Natural Reaſon; and it is reaſonable to conclude without Revelation, that it came</hi> (not from a wicked God, but) <hi>by a Deviation from the right Rule of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon implanted in us,</hi> &amp;c. When two
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:99901:10"/>
               <hi>Deities</hi> butt and knock againſt each other, 'tis no wonder that theſe two <hi>Authors</hi> do the ſame. Only there is this unhappy Difference, that of the <hi>Two Gods,</hi> one is a <hi>very Good</hi> one, which makes ſome Amends for the other who is ſo <hi>very Bad.</hi> But <hi>both</hi> theſe Epiſtlers are of the ſame vile Stamp and Strain. Further, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gives us a diſtinct Account of the State of the Quarrel between God and us; what the Iſſue of it will be, if the Controverſy be not taken up; and how we may be reconciled to him, whom we can never ſucceſsfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; tells us of a Mediator, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a one as Fallen Man ſtands in Need of; what God requires of us, that through him we may eſcape that Wrath and Vengeance that is due to us for Sin; and what we ſhall receive from him in a way of Reward and Puniſhment, according as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his Terms, or refuſe ſo to
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:99901:10"/>do. And it very much preſſes the great Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> a moſt God-like Doctrine, every way worthy of God, and neceſſary for us becauſe of the Corruption of Human Nature: And withal ſhews whither we ſhould apply our ſelves for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, for the changing the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Frame of our Souls, and the amending of our Lives. So much for the <hi>Nature</hi> of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now for the <hi>Proof</hi> of it. The <hi>Word began firſt to be ſpoken by the Lord,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own Will.</hi> And he would never have ſet the Broad Seal of Heaven upon it, if it had been a Cheat, and an Impoſture, and ſo have unavoidably led us into a moſt fatal Error.</p>
            <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:99901:11"/>
            <p>To this may be added, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Spreading</hi> of the Goſpel; which is very Admirable, conſidering the Strictneſs of its Precepts; the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Inſtruments by whom it was propagated; the ſtrong Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was made againſt it every where by Men in Authority, and thoſe of the greateſt Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the general Prejudices with which the Minds of Men were filled againſt it; and its overturning all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religions wherein Men had been Bred and Born; and which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they uſe to be very tenacious of. If it had been a <hi>Lye,</hi> it would never have been ſo bleſſed and proſpered of God.</p>
            <p>Conſider further, what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Reformation</hi> it wrought in the Hearts and Lives of all that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it. Surely that Seal could be no Forgery, but muſt be cut by a Divine Hand, which made ſo many
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:99901:11"/>Divine Impreſſions upon ſuch Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Souls.</p>
            <p>To all which may further be added, The Caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, tho' ſcattered all the World over; yet, contrary to all other Inſtances in Nature, do not mingle and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate with any People, but keep themſelves as a Body diſtinct from all the Nations among whom they dwell. And they are the Filth and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcouring of every Place, even among the Heathens, as well as the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The very <hi>Mahometans</hi> deſpiſe them: The <hi>Indians</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Terry<hi>'s Voyage into the</hi> Eaſt-Indies.</note> have a very Emphatical way, in their Language, of calling a Man <hi>two or three</hi> very ugly Names in <hi>one Compound Word;</hi> yet that of calling a Man a <hi>Jew,</hi> is reckoned worſe than all the Terms of Reproach heaped up together. They are every where ſtanding Monuments
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:99901:12"/>of Divine Vengeance, for rejecting the Goſpel; and a laſting Proof and Teſtimony of the Truth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Prophecies againſt them. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider the many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which they have made, but always in vain; but more eſpecially their laſt, in the Reign, and by the zealous Encouragement of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate Emperor, to rebuild the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> on purpoſe to prove our Saviour a Falſe Prophet; and the miraculous Overthrow of <hi>it,</hi> and his Deſign, by Balls of Fire from Heaven, whereby the Workmen were conſumed, and the ſorry Remains of the Foundations of that Temple were entirely razed, and he made further to <hi>fulfil</hi> the Prophecy of Chriſt by his very attempt to overthrow it; which is teſtified, not only by the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors, but by the <hi>Heathen</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ammianus Marcel. l. 23.</note> alſo.</p>
            <pb n="xxi" facs="tcp:99901:12"/>
            <p>Neither are the <hi>Prophecies</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concering Chriſt to be forgotten: ſuch as that of <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s being <hi>cut off</hi> within ſuch a compaſs of Years;
<note place="margin">Chap. 9.24.</note> which tho' it hath its leſſer Difficulties, yet as to the <hi>main Subſtance</hi> is very plain; and therefore <hi>Porphyry</hi> moſt unreaſonably pretended the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> was a <hi>Hiſtory forged</hi> after the Events came to paſs. And that Prophecy of Chriſt's coming before the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Second Temple.
<note place="margin">Mal. 3.</note> But above all, that which was one great Occaſion of the Converſion of that Noble

<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:99901:13"/>our Saviour's Paſſion, tho' it was wrote many Ages before Chriſt's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World; and which the <hi>Jews,</hi> who abhor the Notion of a Crucified <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and conſtantly Blaſpheme our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſtill kept in their Hands as a Book Divinely inſpired. <hi>Pilate</hi> writ an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription on the Croſs, over the Head of Chriſt, <hi>This is the King of the</hi> Jews, in <hi>Latin, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters.

            <p>And I think we ought not to ſlight the <hi>Acts of Pilate</hi> which he ſent to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> containing a <hi>Narrative</hi> of the
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:99901:13"/>Life, Miracles, Death, and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour. Theſe are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, not only by

<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:99901:14"/>two, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Pardon of Sin,</hi> and a <hi>Future State</hi> of <hi>Happineſs:</hi> becauſe, tho' they have been very lightly touched upon by ſeveral, yet I do not know any that hath thoroughly handled 'em. This <hi>Vein</hi> hath been ſcarce open'd, and then hath been preſently cloſed again: the Skilful Work-men having choſen rather to dig in ſome other Parts of the <hi>Mine;</hi> thinking, it may be, that this might be wrought by the meaner Hand of any Common Labourer; which hath encourag'd me to make the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſſay.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt Chapter</hi> whereof, I have been obliged to encounter ſome very Learned Men, two of which are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd. I have carried it with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Deference to the <hi>Authors,</hi> while I have endeavour'd to Confute their Arguments and Errors. 'Tis great Barbarity rudely to treat the Aſhes of ſuch Men when Dead. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="xxvi" facs="tcp:99901:15"/>walked <hi>ſoftly</hi> over their Graves, and not trampled indecently upon them.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond Chapter,</hi> my Subject hath led me to Cite ſeveral of the Ancient Heathen Philoſophers, tho' I have been far from producing all that I could have brought. I have done as our Courts are wont to do when a <hi>Jury</hi> is Summon'd; I have <hi>Impannell'd</hi> as many as I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to <hi>ſerve</hi> my Purpoſe, and have diſmiſs'd the Supernumeraries.</p>
            <p>Some of the Quotations I have tranſcrib'd at large out of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that the Learned Reader may judge whether I have miſtaken the true Senſe of my Authors, or dealt worſe by them. I deſire no Man to take them, as Traders ſometimes do a Bag of Money, <hi>upon Content,</hi> with a Promiſe of <hi>making them Good;</hi> he who Examines 'em, will <hi>find</hi> them ſo. And that any one who hath an
<pb n="xxvii" facs="tcp:99901:15"/>Ability and a Mind to it, may do it with the greater Eaſe and Readineſs; generally the firſt Time that I quote an Author, I mention the Particular Page and Edition which I have all along made uſe of, where it was Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The Neglect of which, in many Writers, is as idle, as if a Man ſhould direct a Letter to his Friend in <hi>London,</hi> without naming the <hi>Street,</hi> or the <hi>Sign</hi> of the Houſe where he dwells; who thereupon is not to be found without the Expence of much Labour and Time.</p>
            <p>In the rendring of them into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, I have endeavour'd to give their true Senſe, without ſlaviſhly Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my ſelf to a <hi>Verbal</hi> Tranſlation. I hate and deſpiſe the Superſtition of ſome Modern Publiſhers of Books, who can't clap in a <hi>the</hi> or an <hi>of,</hi> tho' it be abſolutely neceſſary to make their Authors intelligible, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reader a very formal No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="xxviii" facs="tcp:99901:16"/>of it by a <hi>turn'd-up Comma,</hi> the Solemnity of an <hi>Italick Character,</hi> and introducing the little Particle with a <hi>Star</hi> prefixed in the Book, as one ſometimes appears in the <hi>Heavens</hi> to Uſher in the Birth of a Young Prince.</p>
            <p>In ſome Places I have endeavour'd to give ſomewhat of a <hi>pleaſant Turn</hi> to a few of their Expreſſions; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the Reading many Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations is a <hi>dull</hi> Buſineſs; tho' I know by Experience 'tis a much <hi>duller</hi> one to gather and tranſcribe 'em. When there is no <hi>Air</hi> nor <hi>Briskneſs</hi> in the Face, the Limner will give a Stroke of his <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> as well as of his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil; unleſs he be as <hi>heavy</hi> a Creature as the Man that <hi>ſits,</hi> or have as little <hi>Life and Soul</hi> in him as the Picture he draws.</p>
            <p>If any think I have been either too Light, or too Severe in a Reflection or two on the Sentiments and Speeches
<pb n="xxix" facs="tcp:99901:16"/>of ſome of the Old Philoſophers: I reply, I have but followed the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Elijah,</hi> who derided the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of <hi>Baal,</hi> that were as Senſeleſs and Empty Tools as the Idol they Worſhipp'd. And I think that a Silly Opinion, or a Ridiculous Saying, deſerves no Veneration, becauſe it hath been an <hi>Ancient</hi> one; or came from a Man, who as many Years as he lived before me, yet it may be was not much Older when he vented it, than I now am, when I ſmile at it and him.

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GH refined and inquiſitive Men have aimed at a perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of All things; yet the Experience of every Age doth convince us, that the Author of Nature hath ſet Bounds to our Knowledge as well as our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; There is a certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding as well as of bodily Stature which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:99901:18"/>exceed; and though in both there is a mighty difference, yet there are many Points which are too high for us, and above the reach of the moſt Elevated Minds. There's none of them, but what an Ingenious Man would be glad to have cleared up; but yet moſt of them are of a Speculative Nature, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whereof would be of very little <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Service, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſafely ſit down in a quiet and contented Ignorance. There is an Obſcurity on the Face of <hi>Light;</hi> and though it manifeſts all other Objects, yet its <hi>Self</hi> is in a great meaſure hidden from us. But were we
<pb facs="tcp:99901:18"/>perfect Maſters of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of it, whether it be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or an Accident, Fire, or the Preſſure of the moſt ſubtil Matter, how it ſo ſwiftly ſpreads, and ſtrikes our Eyes, it would be no help to the Traveller in his Way, or the Labouring Man for the quicker diſpatch of his Work.</p>
            <p>Did a Man throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Cauſe of the <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flowing of the Sea,</hi> and could he demonſtrate it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Motion either of the Sun or Earth, or the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Moon; could he <hi>dive</hi> as deep into that Secret as ſome do into the vaſt Ocean, he
<pb facs="tcp:99901:19"/>would not enrich himſelf by the one as Men do by the other. Could the Mariner reaſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo exactly about the Nature of the <hi>Wind,</hi> open the ſecret Treaſures whence it comes, and point out the inviſible Places whither it retreats, and aſſign the Natural Cauſes of its giddy and uncertain Motions; he could not gather it in his Sails with greater Advantage, nor the ſooner reach his deſired Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome Points of another Nature, the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereof will unavoidably create great Perplexity of Mind in any Conſidering Man. Of
<pb facs="tcp:99901:19"/>theſe I ſhall pitch upon Two, which are of Common Concern to all, and of the greateſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of any that can be mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Pardon of Sin</hi> while we are in this World, and our <hi>Future State</hi> when we leave it, and paſs into the next. And in treating on both of them, I ſhall compare <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſet one againſt the other; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to demonſtrate, againſt the Deiſts of the preſent Age, That if we have no other Guide than the Former, we muſt needs be at a dreadful Loſs, and remain covered with the <hi>Shadow of Death;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 44.19.</note> but if we follow the

               <p>WHenever we are Serious and Retired, our own Hearts will tell us, That God is juſtly and highly diſpleaſed with us for our Sins; and that this Diſpleaſure of his will end in our to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Ruin if it be not removed. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience indeed is not always ſenſible of our Guilt; but 'tis ſoon awaken'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99901:21"/>by any very ſharp Affliction: As the Seeds of ſome Diſtempers float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a man's Blood, upon the Change of Weather, are apt to drop down into a tender and ſenſible Part, cauſing moſt acute Pains in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Patient. No man therefore can have any rational and laſting Peace and Comfort of Mind, who is not well informed about the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sins; which the Chriſtian alone, by the help of his Bible, can attain unto, but the Deiſt muſt be greatly bewildred about, who hath no other Inſtructor than the Light of Nature and Reaſon. For,</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> That cannot fully aſſure us that there is Forgiveneſs of Sin with God. If this could be Certainly known by meer Reaſon, it muſt be gathered, either from the <hi>Eſſential Goodneſs of God,</hi> or elſe from the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Effects of his Bounty and Kindneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99901:21"/>
               <p>From the Former of theſe it can't be <hi>Aſſuredly</hi> inferr'd. For tho' For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sin hath its Riſe and Spring in the Infinite Benignity of God; yet it doth not flow thence by Neceſſity of Nature, but 'tis a free Act of his Will, and the Work of his Soveraign Grace and Pleaſure. And therefore the Argument of the Apoſtle is very ſtrong and clear,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.11.</note> 
                  <hi>As no man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit of a man which is in him: even ſo theſe things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God,</hi> and he to whom he is pleaſed to Reveal them. A ſhrewd Man may gueſs at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Thoughts and Reſolves of his fellow-Creature, but he can't certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know them; much leſs can we in affairs of This nature penetrate into the Mind of God. That Eye which is too weak to reach to the bottom of a ſhallow Stream, can never pierce to the loweſt Depths of the Ocean.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99901:22"/>Sinners are worthy of Puniſhment, and 'tis not inconſiſtent with Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to inflict a deſerved Puniſhment on an Offender. God hath a Right to inflict; and who can aſſure us that he will remit his own Right, unleſs he himſelf declare his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to part with it? God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor can exerciſe one Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of his to the Prejudice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He will not raiſe the honour of his Goodneſs on the Ruins of his Holineſs and Juſtice, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his Authority and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And how to reconcile theſe with the Pardoning of Sinners, is a puzzling Difficulty in which Reaſon cannot help us: And tho' it could, yet he is infinitely Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and therefore at leaſt he <hi>may</hi> reſolve to puniſh the Offender for ought that he knows; ſo that at the beſt it would be with our Souls, as 'tis fabulouſly reported to be with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99901:22"/>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Body in his Iron Coffin, that hangs in the Air between the upper and the neather Load-ſtone; ſo ſhould <hi>we</hi> be in Suſpence between encouraging Hopes and uneaſy Fears, which muſt needs create a mighty Torment in our Minds; this being a matter whereon our Welfare in both Worlds doth ſo intirely depend. The Scriptures tell us (and tho' that will have no weight with a Deiſt, yet it will with thoſe who own their Authority) that notwithſtanding the immenſe Goodneſs of God, yet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who were originally more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures than we, remain bound in Chains of Guilt as well as Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are reſerved to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Great Day. And that there ſhould be Forgiveneſs for fallen Man, when there's none for Apoſtate Angels, who can aſſure us?</p>
               <p>Nor can this be <hi>Certainly</hi> inferr'd from the viſible <hi>Effects of Divine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99901:23"/>Bounty and Goodneſs.</hi> Men perceive indeed that God is Kind; but withal they frequently feel to their Coſt that he is Juſt, and know within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that 'tis <hi>Righteous in him to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Tribulation and Anguiſh to every evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doer.</hi> He doth do it in ſome terrible Inſtances in this World; and for ought that meer Reaſon can tell us, he may do the like in the other World too; tho' he may defer it for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as long as this preſent Life doth laſt; and fill mens Hearts with Food and Gladneſs for a Time, to reward thoſe broken Mixtures of Good that may be in them, or as a Recompence for ſome uſeful Service they may do (tho' his Glory be not deſigned by them therein), or to employ them as the Inſtruments of his Providence for the relieving or vexing of others: or for ſome other wiſe Ends that may be paſt our find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. A Malefactor may know
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99901:23"/>that his Prince is very good and kind, who for wiſe Reaſons of State, which he can't penetrate into, gives him an uncertain Reprieve <hi>ſine Die,</hi> keeps him in an airy Priſon, and feeds him there very plentifully at the Publick Charge: Yet this is but a very ſlender Argument that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhall undoubtedly be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd: Eſpecially if he know him to be a very Juſt and Righteous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who greatly hates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts the foul Crimes he hath been guilty of: And moſt of all, if the Priſoner enter into new Conſpiracies and Rebellions againſt him, while he is ſo lovingly treated: Which is the caſe of all Mankind with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, who are daily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, while they live every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on his Bounty. The utmoſt that can be ſolidly gather'd from the common Patience and Goodneſs of God, is but ſome <hi>looſe and faint
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99901:24"/>Hopes,</hi> which may encourage Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to hearken out and enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a way of Reconciliation with God. The <hi>Ninivites</hi> carried this matter as far as any can by meer natural Light and Reaſon,
<note place="margin">Jonah 3.9.</note> when they ſaid, <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from the fierceneſs of his Anger, that we periſh not?</hi> But then on the other hand, nothing being ſo ſuſpicious as a Guilty creature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he hath to do with a Holy and a Jealous God, he may as well ſay, <hi>Who can tell but that God will Not turn, nor repent, nor turn away from the fierceneſs of his Anger,</hi> and then we muſt periſh, and there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy? We can never have a <hi>firm</hi> Foundation for a <hi>Full and Comfortable perſuaſion,</hi> that God will indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give Sins, unleſs ſome Act of Grace and Indemnity be publiſh'd from Heaven to that end and purpoſe.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99901:24"/>
               <p>Such a one we read of in the Holy Scriptures, in which we have the higheſt Aſſurance that can be either given or deſired. We have a firm word of Promiſe frequently repeated, to build upon. The Son of God came down from Heaven on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to preach this Doctrine in his own Perſon. He hath purchaſed this Bleſſing for us by the ſharpeſt Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. When he returned to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.47.</note> he commanded that <hi>Remiſſion of Sins ſhould be preached in his Name;</hi> and hath ſettled an Order of Men, who are appointed by this Argument to beſeech Sinners to be reconciled to God. This is one expreſs Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the New Covenant which he hath ſealed with his own Blood, that <hi>God will be merciful to our Iniquities, and our Sins he will remember no more.</hi> He bequeathed this as his dying Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy among all his ſincere Followers in his Laſt Will and Teſtament: A
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99901:25"/>Remembrance whereof he would have continually kept up among them; and in order thereunto he inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the Ordinance of the Supper; for the <hi>Cup</hi> which we there drink of, is <hi>the New Teſtament in his Blood, which was ſhed for the Remiſſion of our Sins.</hi> And as a Prieſt he intercedes for this great Bleſſing, and as a King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows it on his People.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> Suppoſe that Natural Light and Reaſon could aſſure us that God would forgive, yet it cannot certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform us <hi>how far this Pardon ſhall reach,</hi> either as to <hi>Perſons, or Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> If we had been left barely to our own Thoughts and Conjectures in this matter, very few, if any, could have had a well-grounded comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Aſſurance, that they in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſhould find Mercy at the hands of God.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:99901:25"/>
               <p>We could not reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, it ſhould be an Univerſal and Unlimited Pardon. Surely God will make Examples of ſome, and, for any thing I know, (might every one ſay) he may make one of Me, among the reſt: If any be excepted, why not I?</p>
               <p>If I am a <hi>mean</hi> and inconſiderable Man, 'tis no great matter; no great loſs, if ſuch an one ſhould periſh: And I am the rather induced to fear that I ſhall, becauſe of the <hi>Inequality</hi> of the Divine Favour, in diſtributing temporal Mercies with ſo Sparing a hand to me, the beſtowing of which is <hi>the chief Ground I have to hope for his Pardon.</hi> And therefore thoſe, who are very low and poor, and under ſuch miſerable circumſtances, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>indure</hi> life, than <hi>injoy</hi> it, have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect the good will of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; to whom he has given ſuch <hi>weak and feeble Motives</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99901:26"/>and ſuch <hi>ſlight Grounds</hi> to hope for a Pardon thereupon.</p>
               <p>If I am a <hi>Man of Figure,</hi> for that very reaſon God may ſingle me out, to make his Power, his Juſtice, and his Wrath, ſo much the more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. And generally wiſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are wont to make ſome ſuch as theſe, Publick Examples of their juſt Diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>But be a man what he will, as to his Circumſtances in this World; there is none but has committed a great many Sins, and ſome of them are of a Crimſon Dye: For where is the Perſon to be found, who has not often offended againſt ſhining Light, and indearing Love; againſt alluring Mercies, and bitter Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; againſt repeated Promiſes, and ſolemn Vows? Now 'tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that any <hi>ſingle</hi> Sin, tho' of the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> Size, will make ſad Work in the Conſcience, if it be ſet home
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99901:26"/>with Power on the Heart: As the diſorder of any minute ſingle part of our Bodies, an inconſiderable Stone, or a ſmall quantity of Gravel in our Reins, will fill us with moſt exquiſite Pain. Yet generally it is the <hi>Multitude</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of mens Sins, and the heinous <hi>Aggravations</hi> of them, that make the deepeſt wound in their Spirits. Hence God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us ſo many repeated Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Holy Word, of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Plenty, the Riches of his pardoning Grace and Mercy; That he will forgive <hi>iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin;</hi> That the Blood of his Son <hi>cleanſeth from all Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe Scriptures are like thoſe <hi>Herbs,</hi> which ſome curious Men tell us of, that have the Signature of thoſe parts of the Body, whoſe Griefs they are deſigned to aſſwage; Or the Figure and Colour of thoſe Diſeaſes, for the Cure whereof the kind Hand of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99901:27"/>Nature has provided them. They clearly <hi>ſhew</hi> our Diſeaſe, as well as are intended to heal it; and plainly ſignify how hard a matter it is to ſettle the peace of a troubled Soul.</p>
               <p>Nay the <hi>Better</hi> and <hi>more Serious</hi> any man is, ſo much the Greater would have been his Uncertainty and Perplexity in this matter: For the Better any man is, the more does he obſerve the inward Corruption of his own Heart, which others take no Notice, and make no Account of; And the deeper Senſe has he of the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, of the Vileneſs of his own Sins, of his Deſert of Wrath and Vengeance, and his Unworthineſs of Divine Favour.</p>
               <p>And every man, but eſpecially ſuch a one knows ſo much More againſt <hi>himſelf,</hi> than he does againſt the Generality of Others; that it is reaſonable for him to conclude, that, all things conſidered, he is <hi>one of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99901:27"/>Chiefeſt of Sinners.</hi> How natural is it therefore, for all, and eſpecially for ſuch, to cry out, Tho' perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture there may be Mercy for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet ſure there is none for Me; I am afraid, that I and My Crimes may be excepted, and that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace ſhall not extend ſo very far as to take Me and my Sins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its Reach and Compaſs; that the Wing of Mercy will not be ſpread ſo wide, as to cover Me, and all my numerous and mighty Offences.</p>
               <p>But now from this miſerable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, <hi>Revelation</hi> doth thoroughly deliver us, by certifying us, that, as <hi>far as the Heavens are above the Earth,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7, 8, 9.</note> ſo far are God's Ways and Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ours:</hi> And therefore he is ready <hi>Abundantly to pardon.</hi> Our Bleſſed Lord hath told us,
<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31.</note> 
                  <hi>All manner of Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven. Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy</hi> is a wounding the Name of God. Now every Man is tender of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99901:28"/>his Reputation as of the Apple of his Eye, and God is jealous of his own Honour. Yet, not only all other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, but even this too, of what ſort and kind ſoever, tho' attended with very aggravating Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhall be forgiven <hi>unto Men;</hi> 'tis ſpoken indefinitely, to <hi>Any</hi> Man, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways provided he comply with the Conditions of the Goſpel), <hi>the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And 'tis very obſervable how theſe words are brought in. Our Saviour was now moſt highly provok'd by the malicious Phariſees, whoſe malignant Souls were poſſeſt by a worſe Devil than any of the Bodies of thoſe who were healed by him, and therefore wickedly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Miracles to the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. Our Lord did moſt heinouſly reſent this, as well he might. And yet before he thunders out Wrath and Vengeance againſt them, words
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99901:28"/>of Grace drop from his Lips towards others, and Mercy gets the ſtart of Juſtice. He begins with theſe words, <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, All manner of Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men;</hi> and afterwards adds, <hi>But the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be ſo.</hi> And the Apoſtle tells us, that among others, this is one peculiar Excellency of Chriſt's Goſpel above <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, That whereas he that deſpiſed the latter by Sinning preſumptuouſly againſt it, died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Mercy; yet through the former ſuch an Ample Forgiveneſs was preached,
<note place="margin">Acts 13.38, 39.</note> 
                  <hi>that by him all that believe are juſtified from All things from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> And at another time; That <hi>where Sin has Abounded,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.</note> there Grace ſhall much more Abound; i. e.</hi> upon mens Compliance with the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Terms which God hath ſettled. Which brings me to the</p>

               <p>But to this I Reply, This whole arguing proceeds on a wrong Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, That the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Offender is the <hi>only end of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment:</hi> Whereas Satisfaction to the

               <p>How confidently ſoever ſome Men may talk, yet they have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe of all Mankind lying againſt them.

The Heathens ſaw ſomewhat more was neceſſary

Let any man conſider the numerous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities wherewith many times the World is covered as with a black Cloud, behold the Strugglings of dying Infants, liſten to the Cries of a wounded Spirit, and attend to the Groans of a departing Sinner, and then let him judge whether the Sins of Men are Acts of <hi>Weakneſs</hi> in God's Account and Eſteem.</p>
               <p>Scripture indeed is brought in to countenance this ſtrange Aſſertion: For 'tis ſaid

                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 103.14.</note> But if we read on to the end of the Verſe, it will appear that this is not ſpoken

                  <hi>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth:</hi> as is evident from the following words, which contain the true reaſon of theſe; not becauſe their Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are <hi>the weak Acts of finite and fallible Creatures,</hi> &amp;c. but becauſe then <hi>the Spirit ſhould fail before me, and the Souls which I have made.</hi> I might add, This is a Gracious Promiſe, which we know by meer Revelation, whereas we are treating of what may be known by the meer Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, no Man would with any Patience bear ſuch a Plea as this in the Mouth of his Servant or Child, for their wilful Contempt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99901:37"/>of his Authority. And ſuch talk as this, is one of the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ways to give a fatal Check to the working of that Repentance which ſome deſign ſo much to extol; and which indeed can hardly be extolled too much, provided Men do it not ſo, as to juſtle a Mediator, and the Neceſſity of Faith in him in order to forgiveneſs, out of the World. For the chief Conſideration that melts down an Ingenuous Spirit into a Godly Sorrow, is this, the Wiſdom, Majeſty, Authority, Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Juſtice of God whom he hath diſpleaſed. So that ſome Men by endeavouring to advance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, do indeed diminiſh and diſcourage it; as the Sun by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up Vapours out of a River, leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens the Quantity of Water that was in it.</p>

And God may, tho' he Chaſtize the Guilty, be for ever ſecure of the Reputation of that his Goodneſs, having given abundant Demonſtrations of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all his Creatures, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing further how in a glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to diſplay it towards thoſe who never offended him.

But in a way of <hi>Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation</hi> he doth <hi>Gain</hi> very much in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Sinners. For hereby he doth evidence his Holineſs, and Hatred of Sin, the Severity of his Juſtice, and the Exactneſs of his Truth, which is no ſuch very SORRY AMENDS for Tranſgreſſion, as it is very unwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily aſſerted to be. And 'tis as true he may, and doth <hi>Gain</hi> very much in this Senſe in pardoning Sinners for the ſake of Chriſt's Satisfaction on their Repentance and Faith in him.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99901:41"/>on meer Repentance without any reſpect to the atoning Blood of a Mediator (of which unenlighten'd Reaſon knows not a Syllable) doth not yet appear. And tho' he loſe the Hearts of Sinners whom he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, yet we have Reaſon to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (what Revelation doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly aſſure us of) that the bright and ſpacious Heavens are filled with nobler Inhabitants than the little Spot of this dirty Earth, on which we tread: that there are (to uſe the Words of an

Wiſe Governors are not wont to receive into Favour great Offenders, who have gone on in a long courſe of Rebellion, upon their firſt Offers of Submiſſion. If we have nothing but
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99901:43"/>our own Reaſon to guide us, we might well ſuppoſe, that in Order to make us more deeply ſenſible of our Crimes, and teach us the Value of ſo great a Mercy, God may let us ſtand a long while in an humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent manner at his Gate, before he vouchſafe to open it to us, if ever he do ſo. Now beſides that Uneaſineſs of Mind which the being held in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in ſo important an Affair, muſt needs create in a Serious and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Perſon, there is this further afflictive Conſideration, That our Lives are very ſhort and uncertain. And if the King of Terrors ſhould ſeize us before our Peace be made with God, we are undone: Or if it ſurprize us before we have any ſolid Grounds to believe he is reconciled to us, our Departure out of this World will be like that of a Malefactor out of his Priſon, who goes trembling to the Place of Execution, knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               </p>
               <p>There are indeed two Paſſages in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which ſeem to oppoſe this; and 'tis ſufficiently
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99901:45"/>known how the <hi>Novatians</hi> abuſed them of Old; and many ſerious, but weak Chriſtians, have in all Ages been tormented through a miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them. Which therefore I ſhall largely conſider, and ſo much the rather, becauſe being rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, I am afraid they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have a very black Aſpect on ſome of our preſent Deiſts. The one is,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.4, 5, 6.</note> That <hi>it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlighten'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance, ſeeing they Crucify to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open Shame.</hi> The other is of the like Import:
<note place="margin">Ch. 10.26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after that we have received the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for Sins; but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which ſhall devour the Adverſaries.</hi> This paſſage, at the firſt View, ſeems to render the caſe

                     </gap>.</note> which is the Softer word of the two. And who is there that dares to deny but that he hath been guilty of many Voluntary Sins, even ſince he hath received the Knowledge of the Truth?</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall endeavour to prove, that both theſe Places are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood barely of the <hi>Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> only it would be attended in theſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> if they ſhould be guilty of it, with more aggravating Circumſtances, than that ſame Sin in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied withal. Becauſe the Perſons offending are ſuppoſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99901:46"/>once to have been the Profeſſed Diſciples of Chriſt, which the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> never were; and becauſe if they ſhould commit it, they would ſin againſt greater Miracles for the proof of Chriſtianity, ſince the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For here is the Characteriſtical Note whereby our Bleſſed Saviour hath diſtinguiſh'd the Blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt from all other Sins and Blaſphemies whatſoever, <hi>viz.</hi> the Unpardonableneſs of it. In the former of theſe Places it is ſaid, that 'tis <hi>Impoſſible to renew theſe men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> Which is in other words to ſay, 'tis Impoſſible they ſhould be forgiven. For why is it, that the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be forgiven, but becauſe 'tis impoſſible they ſhould ever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent who have been guilty of it? And then the Apoſtle in the very next
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99901:47"/>words doth oppoſe them that ſhould be guilty of this Sin, to that <hi>Ground which receiveth Bleſſing from God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6.7, 8.</note> and compares them to that which <hi>beareth thorns and briars, and is rejected and nigh unto Curſing, and whoſe End is to be burnt.</hi> And in the latter place the Apoſtle tells us, that as for theſe Men,
<note place="margin">Ch. 10.26.</note> 
                  <hi>there remaineth no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for Sins.</hi> Which words are a plain Alluſion to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in which no Expiations were allowed or appointed for Heinous and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sins, but he who was guilty of them, was to be put to Death without any Favour. 'Tis as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, There is no other Sacrifice for Sins but what the Son of God hath offered up; this they impiouſly reject, and Chriſt never deſign'd to make any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement by his Blood for the Sin I am now ſpeaking of, and there is no other: And where there is no
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99901:47"/>Expiation, there can be no Pardon. He further adds,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>27</label> There <hi>remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> for theſe men, <hi>but a certain fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking for of judgment, and fiery Indignation which ſhall devour the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi> What more Significant and Emphatical Words could the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle uſe to expreſs the Unpardonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Crime? And yet as tho' this had not been enough, he further compares their Caſe to that of thoſe Men <hi>who deſpiſed the law of Moſes,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ver. </seg>28,</label> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by renouncing or abjuring it, or Sinning impudently and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt it, and who therefore <hi>died without Mercy.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> And to convince us that the Offenders he is ſpeaking of, ſhould be unavoidably preſſed to Death, he lays more Weight on them than on the Deſpiſers of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. For, ſaith he, <hi>Of how much ſorer Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:99901:48"/>
               <p>'Tis further evident from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sin here mentioned, that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt. The formal nature of that dreadful Sin I take to be this, A malicious reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Bleſſed Saviour as an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and Deceiver, imputing the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which he wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God for the Confirmation of his Holy Doctrine and Miſſion, to the Power of the Devil. A man would wonder, if there were not a thouſand Inſtances of the like kind, how ſo many Learned Men could make a ſhift ſo much to miſtake this clear and plain notion of this Sin, and give us ſo many Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Opinions concerning it, as widely diſtant from each other, as all of them are from the Truth; who doth but conſider how St. <hi>Mark</hi> cloſes the Speech of our Saviour concerning it. For he winds up all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99901:48"/>with theſe remarkable words,
<note place="margin">Mark 3.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe they ſaid, he hath an Unclean Spirit:</hi> which give us a clear Light whereby to diſcern the nature of this Sin. But ſome rather chuſe, as an Evidence of their great Strength, to endeavour to break through the Walls, than turn the <hi>Key</hi> that is very plainly in the Door, and would eaſily open it, and let them into the Houſe.</p>
               <p>Now that 'tis this Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reproaching Chriſt as a Deceiver, the Apoſtle is here ſpeaking of, will appear from the Expreſſions which he uſeth concerning it. He calls it <hi>a Crucifying the Son of God afreſh,
<note place="margin">Ch. 6.6. Ch. 10.29.</note> and putting him to an open Shame: A treading him under foot, and counting his Blood an unholy thing, and doing Deſpite to the Spirit of Grace.</hi> All which do amount to this, That they eſteemed Chriſt to be a Vile Malefactor, a wretched Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99901:49"/>that his Miracles, which for the Matter of Fact they could not deny, were wrought by the help of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Powers, and therefore he was deſervedly put to death; and had it been to do again, they would as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily have done it, as ever the Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Jews</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Sin here ſpoken of, in one of the Places,
<note place="margin">Ch. 6.6.</note> is called <hi>a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away,</hi> and that from the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> which in the Verſes immediately foregoing he had newly mentioned;
<note place="margin">Ver. 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Renouncing of the Chriſtian Faith, and Returning either to <hi>Judaiſm</hi> or <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> which theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> were in great danger of, and which 'tis the apparent Deſign of this Epiſtle to fortify them againſt. And tho' in the other place it be called only in the General <hi>a Sinning Wilfully</hi> or <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ch. 10.26.</note> yet thereby the ſame thing is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99901:49"/>meant. For juſt before the Apoſtle had been exhorting them to <hi>hold faſt the Profeſſion of their Faith without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi>

And then theſe Words are brought in, <hi>For if we ſin wilfully,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> If we caſt away the Profeſſion of our Faith, forſake the Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and renounce the Doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now it is worthy of our careful Obſervation, that the Heathens, but eſpecially the <hi>Jews,</hi> were ſo implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bent againſt our Bleſſed Lord, that tho' a Chriſtian did deſert the Aſſemblies of the Faithful, and offer to join with them in their Judaical or Pagan Religion and Worſhip, yet this <hi>alone</hi> would not ſuffice; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they required an expreſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99901:50"/>Abjuring, and Reviling, and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſt as an Impoſtor. And without this, their Rage was never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; and to ſpeak in the modern Language, they never thought they had fully performed all the neceſſary <hi>Duties of New Converts.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So much ſhall ſuffice to prove, that 'tis the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; but a more Aggravated one than that of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that is meant in both theſe Places. And if

               <p>But provided a man hath not gone ſo great a Length as this is, how many ſoever his Sins and Back-ſlidings from God have been, yet on a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deep and Sincere Repentance, and a lively Faith in the Blood of Chriſt, they ſhall be remitted.

               <p>Moreover, by the Light of Nature we can't attain to a well-grounded Confidence, that if God ſhould turn away his Wrath from us, he will, beſides this, receive us into the Arms and Embraces of his Love; become a Friend, as well as ceaſe to be an Enemy; not only refrain from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtizing, but alſo feaſt a Returning Prodigal; beſides the laying of the Storm, cauſe the Sun to ſhine, and <hi>lift up the light</hi> of his holy <hi>Countenance</hi> on our Souls, and bleſs us with a ſenſe of his <hi>Loving-kindneſs, which is better than Life.</hi> Tho' <hi>David</hi> was ſo far reconciled to <hi>Abſalom</hi> as not to Execute him, yea to permit him to return to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet for a long time he would not Suffer him to ſee his Face.</p>

That all the Strokes he gives them are like thoſe of a Statuary on his ill-ſhaped Marble, to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beautiful Image and Form, and ſo make them more meet to grace and adorn the Heavenly Building which they are deſigned for.

               </head>
               <p>THis is what no Wiſe and Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, but muſt be deeply concerned about, and cannot chuſe but be very uneaſy in his own Mind if he has not ſome clear Account of it, which he may ſecurely depend upon. For,</p>
               <p>We are <hi>capable</hi> of ſubſiſting in another State, and of being either very happy, or very miſerable in it, if God ſo pleaſe. There can be no rational Doubt of this, but that the ſame Almighty Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which brought us into, and hath kept us in this World ſo long, ſometimes Comforting, and at other times Afflicting us, can do
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99901:56"/>the like in the next, and that in much higher Degrees, and to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity if he pleaſe. And,</p>
               <p>As <hi>Reaſonable Creatures,</hi> we have a Proſpect of, and a Concern for, Futurity. It is the Privilege of our Natures, that we can move this way or that, ſtep back in our own Thoughts to what is paſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alſo to what is yet to come. And every Wiſe man will be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently looking before him, often thinking what is like to be his State hereafter.</p>
               <p>And in all Ages <hi>all Sorts of Men,</hi> as far as we Certainly know, in all Nations, tho' never ſo Ignorant and Brutiſh, Wicked and Barbarous, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to or remote from each other, have agreed in this, tho' in a very few things beſides, <hi>viz.</hi> A Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that there is a Future State of Happineſs and Miſery. Whether this was the Effect of Tradition, or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99901:57"/>the Concluſion of their own Reaſon, or whether it was derived down to us, together with our Being from our Firſt Parents, the Notion of it being <hi>engraven</hi> on them with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand, and we taking the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi> being wrought off from them; I ſhall not now diſpute. The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact is certain, and that's ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make any Man deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about it, ſeeing 'tis the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe of all Mankind; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe,</p>
               <p>As <hi>Lovers of our Selves,</hi> we cannot chuſe, but earneſtly deſire to enjoy the one and avoid the other. And yet,</p>
               <p>As <hi>Sinners,</hi> we cannot but know our ſelves to be unworthy of the Former, and very Liable to the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And therefore Certainty in this matter is deſirable on that Account: As alſo,</p>

               <p>Laſtly, The more Holy and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Men are, the more Inquiſitive be they about, the more Deſirous of, a future State of Bliſs.

'Tis with Holy Souls as with Men at Sea, the violent Agitations of the ſtormy Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein they Sail, make them Sick and Weary of this preſent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Affairs, and earneſtly long
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99901:60"/>to be in a better and more ſettled Place. It is not more natural for a Seed, when it is quickened, to cleave its way through the Clods of the Earth, and lift up its head into the free and open Air; than it is for the good Principle, proportionably to its Increaſe in the Soul, to ſhoot up in fervent Deſires and Breathings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Heavenly State. Upon all theſe Conſiderations, a ſatisfactory Account of it cannot but be very deſirable. And tho' a ſenſeleſs <hi>Logg</hi> may, yet a Conſidering Man cannot be carried down the ſwift and haſty Stream, without many Thoughts, Whither am I going? And how is it like to be with me in that other World, to which I am making ſuch viſible and daily Approaches?</p>

But it ſeems it was more than he could do. For, among others, he hath theſe words:
<note n="*" place="bottom">Phoedo, p. 91.</note> 
                  <hi>IF THE THINGS WHICH I SAY ARE TRUE, 'tis good to be perſwaded of them: But if nothing of a man doth remain after he is dead, nevertheleſs this little time which I have to live will be the more pleaſant: And after Death, it will be no diſadvantage to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:99901:67"/>
               <p>Upon this he endeavours to prove the Point as well as he could; and then, for want of better matter, at large relates ſome of the <hi>Poetical Dreams</hi> about the Future State; and thereupon concludes, as well he might, that it doth not <hi>become a man of Senſe to aver, that what he hath reported is true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Had not <hi>Socrates</hi> been really at a great Plunge, <hi>Plato</hi> would never have ſo far tranſgreſs'd the Rules of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency which he well underſtood, and at other times was wont to obſerve, as at every Turn to bring him in thus Heſitating and Doubting: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering the <hi>Weight</hi> of the Subject, and the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of his Maſter, who now lay under the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death. And a Learned and Dying Man makes but an Odd Figure when he is brought in Dropping <hi>ſo many</hi> Suſpicious Words about the Future State, if he really be clear in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99901:68"/>his own Mind about it. It looks more like Diſtruſt and Fear, than Humility and Modeſty. And of all Men it was moſt intolerable in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who from an irkſome Senſe of the miſerable Uncertainty and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of other parts of Learning, ſet up for a <hi>Reformer</hi> of Philoſophy, and was altogether for <hi>Ethicks,</hi> correcting the Manners of Men, and promoting good Living in the World, the great Encouragement whereunto is a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reward. For even Vertue it ſelf, as <hi>Fair</hi> as it is, like other <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> is not like to be warmly Courted by many, if it have no Dowry. Add to all this, That he was not now talking to the Rabble, but diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his Intimate, Learned and Philoſophical Friends, with whom he ſhould have dealt more openly and freely; and that ſo much the rather, becauſe all along they are brought in as much unſatisfied in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99901:68"/>their own Minds. From all which Conſiderations 'tis evident, tho' he talked much, yet he knew but little of the matter. And even for that alſo, 'tis not unlikely that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to others. He (as well as they that ſucceeded him) reſembled the New Moon, the far greateſt part of whoſe Face is cover'd with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the ſmall remainder which is not ſo, ſhines with but a faint, pale, yea and a borrowed Light too.</p>
               <p>If any one ſhall ſay, that <hi>Plato</hi> uſed an unaccountable Liberty in ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo much of his own Sentiments with the Speeches of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that like an interpolated Book, 'tis hard to know what was his own, and what belonged to his Maſter; I ſhall not deny it: Becauſe I find, that, when <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf heard him once repeat his

                  <hi>If it be an Error that the Souls of Men are Immortal, I am pleaſed to err, and I will never, as long as I live, be beaten out of it: But if when I am dead (as ſome little Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99901:75"/>whereof theſe Words are a part, as 'tis ſet down, was made for her by <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> according to the uſual cuſtom of moſt Hiſtorians, who are wont to put Words into the Mouths of thoſe Perſons whoſe Actions they relate, and don't ſo much tell us what <hi>They</hi> ſpake, as what <hi>Themſelves</hi> would have ſaid, had they been to have made a ſet Oration under the ſame Circumſtances; wherein they frequently over-do, make them talk much finer than it can rationally be ſuppoſed <hi>They</hi> are capable of doing; lay on ſo much <hi>Paint,</hi> that it eaſily appears to an obſerving Eye to be the work of Art, and not of Nature: But be it the Incomparable <hi>Veturia,</hi> or the Grave <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> 'tis not very material.

               <p>Now if it were thus with the moſt Learned and Sagacious Men, with the moſt Elevated and Exalted Souls; how ſad in all likelihood muſt it needs be with the Body of Mankind? If they who had got the Higher Ground above the Heads of the Common People, and had the Advantage too of ſtanding on one another's Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, could ſee ſuch a little way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'em; what ſhall we think of the little Creatures that ſate below? In ſhort, we do not find that Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life in the other State was in any Heathen Nation an Article of Religion eſtabliſhed by Law. It was but ſlightly touch'd on by Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers when ever they did name it, which was but ſeldom, as a Motive to excite Men to the Practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Other Arguments they uſe and truſt to, which they did better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; and it is Prudence for a man not to urge thoſe Reaſons which
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:99901:76"/>are ſtrongeſt in themſelves, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fight with that Weapon which he is a Maſter of, and knows how beſt to manage. And 'tis a ſhrewd Obſervation of
<note n="*" place="bottom">St. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> de Civit. Dei, l. 4. c. 22. l. 6. c. 9.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That tho' the Heathens had abundance of Gods, to whom they did particularly apply themſelves, to one for one Bleſſing, to another God for another Favour; and therefore the Knowledge of the Gods was neceſſary, that they might direct themſelves to them aright, and not ask Water from the God of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet <hi>Varro</hi> himſelf, who was very well skill'd in the matter, hath not mentioned ſo much as one God, whom they were to pray unto for Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, we who have been taught from our very Infancy by the Goſpel, that there is ſuch a Place as Heaven, and ſo glorious a
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:99901:76"/>Reward for the Righteous in the other State, may be apt to think, that we have hit upon it by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our own unaſſiſted Reaſon, or that it was very eaſy ſo to have done. But herein it fares with us, as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it doth with a Studious Man, who having familiarly convers'd with good Authors, doth verily think ſome of thoſe Notions and Expreſſions too which he hath learnt from them, are the genuine Off-ſpring of his own Mind and Thought. Juſt as Corn that ſprings up in ſome places, ſeems to the Husbandman to be the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Product of the Ground, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never ſowed it with that ſort of Grain; the Seeds of which, in Reality, were taken up by the Wind from another Field whereto they did ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally belong, and inviſibly dropt down there. I can't better expreſs my Senſe of this than in the Words of a modern Author, who herein
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99901:77"/>ſpeaks very well, tho' judging by the main Deſign of his Book, I take him to be a very <hi>Singular Unitarian,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he cuts off all the neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our Faith, excepting that of <hi>the Belief of Jeſus to be the Meſſiah;</hi> tho' I charitably hope he doth not ſet Chriſtianity on <hi>one ſingle Foot,</hi> that it may be the more eaſily puſhed down.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Reaſonab. of Chriſtianity, <hi>p.</hi> 276, 277, 278.</note> 
                  <hi>When Truths are known to us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we are apt to be favourable to our own Parts; and aſcribe to our own Underſtandings the Diſcovery of what in Truth we borrowed from others: — and Truths which we are now ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of, we conclude our own Faculties would have led us into without any Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.—A great many things we have been bred up in the Belief of, from our Cradles, (and are Notions grown Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and as it were Natural to us under
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99901:77"/>the Goſpel) we take for unqueſtionable obvious Truths, and eaſily demonſtrable, without conſidering how long we might have been in Doubt or Ignorance of them, had Revelation been ſilent: And many are beholden to Revelation who do not acknowledge it.</hi> But Revelation is little beholden to ſuch ungrateful Creatures, how much ſoever they may be to it.</p>
               <p>If we lay that aſide, I do not ſee how a Man can be <hi>fully ſatisfied</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Future State of <hi>Bliſs.</hi> We may indeed, by the Light of Nature and Reaſon, be ſure that there is a State of Future <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> becauſe of the great and almoſt uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Proſperity of many wicked Men in this World. As ſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I am, that there is a God and a Providence, ſo ſure I am that there will be a day of Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning with theſe Men, and they ſhall feel that Vengeance hereafter,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99901:78"/>that does not overtake them here.</p>
               <p>But by the meer Light of Reaſon, I cannot be <hi>fully aſſured</hi> that there is a State of Future <hi>Rewards</hi> for good Men: For this great Bar and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection lies againſt it, That the beſt of Men are Sinners, and Great ones too; and have deſerved to ſuffer far worſe things, upon that Account, than any they meet with here. And Deliverance from that Wrath and Torment, which the beſt of Men are liable to, and worthy of, in the next World; that, tho' alone, would be an unſpeakable Favour. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly conclude more from the Goodneſs of God, nor reflect upon him as an hard Maſter if he proceed no further. A vile Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal has abundant Reaſon to thank his Prince, if he give him his Life, which he has forfeited over and over; and cannot with Modeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, beſides this, to be received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99901:78"/>the Number of his ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and be highly preferred by him.</p>
               <p>But now the Goſpel-Revelation does give us a full Aſſurance in this matter: Chriſt has made it a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article of our Faith, has eſtabliſhed it as a main Principle of his Religion:
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.25.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the Promiſe that he has promiſed us, even Eternal Life.</hi> He has not only given us ſome dark Hints about it, but ſet it in a clear Light, and open Day.
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> We do not gather it by a <hi>long Train</hi> of rational Inferences from what he has ſaid, which would make but little Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: For as a Line, the further it is drawn forth, the more does it <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and <hi>tremble;</hi> ſo the longer the Train of Deductions is in matters of a <hi>Moral</hi> Nature, the more hovering is our Aſſent to any Truth, and the leſs Efficacy has it on our Souls: And whatever the Learned may do,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99901:79"/>yet the Common People have not Leiſure or Capacity for the ſpinning of a long and fine Thread. But Chriſt has <hi>plainly</hi> told us of this, and that not once or twice only, or by the bye; but repeated it often, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and deſignedly, ſo that we meet with it in almoſt every Page of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>To the Promiſe there is annexed the Oath of God; not that this makes the matter more certain <hi>in it ſelf:</hi> For God can no more be guilty of Lying than of Perjury. But the Oath is added to the Promiſe <hi>for our ſakes,</hi> to create the ſtronger Belief of it in us, whom Guilt makes ſo very jealous: Like the Publick Stamp on a piece of Silver, which doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the intrinſick Value of it, but only makes it the more Current. <hi>God willing more Abundantly to ſhew to the Heirs of Promiſe the Immutability of his Counſel,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17, 18.</note> confirmed it by an Oath;
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99901:79"/>that by two Immutable things in which it was impoſſible for God to lie;</hi> i. e. to deceive us, <hi>we might have the ſtronger Conſolation.</hi> This Promiſe hath alſo been ratified by the Blood of Chriſt, whereby the whole of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and among the reſt this, which is one of the main Branches of it, hath been Confirmed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, he has alſo given us an unqueſtionable Pledge of it, in his own Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, whither <hi>he is entred as our Fore-runner;</hi> which is as fully te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to us, as any Matter of Fact can poſſibly be, by all his Diſciples, who could not be deceived in ſuch an Object of Senſe; and were Men of ſuch great Piety and Honeſty, that they would not deceive us if they could; and who ſealed their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with their very Blood, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed all that they ſaid with the Loſs of their Lives, and all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99901:80"/>of them. And there is this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſervable, That when Chriſt was Aſcending, the Angels aſſured them who ſtood by and ſaw it; <hi>This ſame Jeſus,
<note place="margin">Act. 1.11.</note> which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him go into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And the ſelf-ſame Pen-man, in his Goſpel (which ſhould have been immediately joined to the Acts of the Apoſtles, had it not been for St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel intervening) tells us the Manner of his Aſcenſion:
<note place="margin">Luk. 24.50, 51.</note> 
                  <hi>He lifted up his hands, and bleſſed them: And while he bleſſed them, he was parted from them, and taken up into Heaven.</hi> He ſhall <hi>ſo</hi> come in <hi>like manner,</hi> when his Work of Interceſſion is finiſhed; Our great High-Prieſt ſhall come out of the Holy of Holies, to <hi>Bleſs</hi> his People, and appear <hi>without Sin unto their Eternal Salvation.</hi>

Poſſibly here and there a Paſſage or two looking that way, may be pick'd up; but a Man muſt
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99901:90"/>go deep for that Ore; and when he hath got it up, 'tis ſo ſmall, that 'tis loſt in the much greater Quantity of Droſs; and like the Silver that's found in ſome Countries, the Separation is very difficult, and what is brought up will not bear the Charges of Digging and Refining. So far was <hi>Plutarch</hi> from having any raiſed and ſettled Apprehenſions of this, that in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Tranquillity of the Mind,</hi> where one would have expected it, inſtead of ſome noble <hi>Flight</hi> he can hardly lift up his Wings above the Ground. Tho' in another place
<note n="*" place="bottom">De Iſide, p. 382.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he drops a noble Saying in the midſt of a heap of wild Stuff, where it ſtands like a fair Houſe quite out of the Road, and in the midſt of a dirty Bottom, in which none would have looked for it, nor can ſee it till he be juſt upon it: That <hi>the Souls
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99901:91"/>of Men, while in the Body, have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, but only as they have ſome little Knowledge of him, as in a Dream by the help of Philoſophy: but when being diſmiſſed from the Body, they enter on that pure, inviſible and impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble State, God is their Ruler, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, and behold without Satiety, and deſire that Beauty which Men are not able to expreſs.</hi> But herein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded himſelf, and ſpake above what he did at other times: For the Higheſt that he could reach, when he was treating on a Subject where it was moſt proper for him to have brought it in, was this:
<note n="*" place="bottom">De Tranquill. Animae. Operum, p. 476.</note> 
                  <hi>He that hath learned the Nature of the Soul, and thinks that by Death it ſhall gain a Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or at leaſt not a WORSE Condition, has no ſmall Freedom from the Fear of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:99901:91"/>
               <p>And that is as high as meer Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can carry any Man, that we ſhall not be in a <hi>WORSE Condition.</hi> Now this would be but a melancholy Conſideration, to be ſent into juſt ſuch another World as this is, and be doomed to live Eternally in it. The Comforts of the preſent State are fickle and uncertain, empty and frothy; its Troubles are maſſy and heavy. And ſuch of 'em as are of a <hi>lighter</hi> nature, many times miſerably diſcompoſe us: As the Modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers tell us, that a <hi>Column of Air</hi> (a thin and ſlight Body) preſſes very hard upon us. Whatever it may be in the <hi>Phyſical,</hi> in the <hi>Moral</hi> Senſe 'tis an undoubted Truth, that there are <hi>Vacuities</hi> and Empty Spaces in every Part of this World; they are <hi>ſpungy</hi> and hollow Subſtances which we feed upon. They who have drunk at the River-Head, have never been able to quench their Thirſt, nor
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99901:92"/>could they be ſatisfied with any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments here below. <hi>Young</hi> Men, not having experienced the Vanity of them, think the Good things of this Life to be very Valuable; but in a little while they ſee their own Error and Miſtake; and that what they took for a Diamond, is but congealed Water, eaſily melted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Fingers; or a Glaſs-drop that is ſhiver'd in pieces with one Touch of a Man's Hand. If <hi>Grace</hi> has not mortified us to this World; yet Age, Senſe, Reaſon, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will make us weary of it: A place wherein a Good and Wiſe Man has hardly Patience to hold out li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ſo ſhort a Space of Time as ſeventy or eighty Years. How ſad would it be, to be always chained down to ſuch an Element of Sin and Sorrow, without any Capacity or Hope of being ever removed? How ſlow are the Minutes, how tedious
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:99901:92"/>are the Hours to a Man in Miſery? Time to ſuch a one is like the Shadow on a Dial, which he that looks upon can't perceive that it moves at all. And yet many of the Calamities we groan under, we know before-hand will be what the Fathers ſaid of <hi>Julian</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, a <hi>little,</hi> tho' a black <hi>Cloud, which will quickly blow over.</hi> At the worſt we always have this to relieve us, that in the <hi>Grave,</hi> (to which we know not how near we may be,)
<note place="margin">Job 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>the Weary are at Reſt.</hi> And yet in the Thoughts of the Pained Man, as well as in the Style of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> a ſingle <hi>Day</hi> ſtands for a <hi>Year.</hi> How intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then muſt it needs be to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Creature, to think, I am in a Region of Miſery, where there is a conſtant Revolution of Day and Night; and in the <hi>Climate</hi> wherein I dwell, theſe are very unequally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the latter uſually being much Longer than the former! Were I to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99901:93"/>linger out ſome Thouſands of Years only, it were ſad; but 'tis infinitely worſe than ſo with me: For, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man that I am, thus muſt I lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh away to the Ages of Eternity, without any hopes of a better State.</p>
               <p>But now the <hi>Goſpel-Revelation</hi> drives away theſe black and gloomy Thoughts and Fears, as the Riſing-Sun doth the Darkneſs and Horror of the Night.

To ſay nothing of the Juſtice of God, it ſeems inconſiſtent with the Divine Wiſdom to require no more than theſe. For all prudent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are always wont to obſerve a Proportion between the Rewards that are offered, and thoſe Services for which they are propoſed; even the higheſt Generoſity muſt, in ſome meaſure, be conducted by this Rule, or elſe it degenerates into Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and Folly. For the propoſing vaſt Recompences for very ſlight and trivial Matters, betrays great Want of Judgment, in not ſetting a true value upon things, either upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or Services, or both.</p>
               <p>Now, by the Law of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we owe God all poſſible Duty and Obedience, a great deal more than the beſt of us do yield to him:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99901:113"/>And ſhould God have exacted it on the Account of his Sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us, without promiſing us any thing at all, much leſs any great Matters; we had been indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſably obliged to it. And our beſt Actions ſtand in need of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſo far are they from deſerving to be Crowned. Nothing in us, or done by us, can bear the leaſt Proportion to the Heavenly Glory. And therefore, that beſides a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, God ſhould promiſe us Eternal Life as the Reward of what we do for him, is what can hardly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Thoughts.</p>
               <p>But now Revelation does relieve us in this Matter.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99901:114"/>but alſo merited Everlaſting Glory for us: And that the Deſign of this whole Affair, is, to magnify the Riches of God's Grace, and ſhow the vaſt Regard he has to the Death and Interceſſion of his own Son, that on <hi>his Account</hi> he offers ſuch an unſpeakable Reward to us;
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> 
                  <hi>That as Sin has reigned unto Death, ſo might Grace reign through Righteouſneſs to Eternal Life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> It is not for any <hi>Works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we have done,</hi> or can do; it is not becauſe of their Intrinſick Worth, that ſuch great Things are given to us. Heaven is the Purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood, it is for <hi>His</hi> Sake we are accepted and rewarded: And ſo upon our Faith and Obedience, we freely receive the Bleſſings which he hath merited: And the more we abound therein, the greater is our Reward, not becauſe of our Merits, but becauſe of God's gracious Promiſe,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99901:114"/>and Reſpect to the Blood of his Son; for which he aſſigns us different Degrees of Glory, in Proportion to our different Meaſures of Holineſs and Obedience.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99901:115"/>can we have from the meer Light of Nature, of Divine Help for the accompliſhing this great and neceſſary Work? Whether any ſhall ever enjoy it; ſeeing the ſame Sins that make us need it, render us moſt unworthy of it? Or in what <hi>Proportions</hi> it ſhall be given forth, and how <hi>long</hi> it ſhall be continued? Whether the Spirit of God ſhall be like thoſe <hi>Periodical Winds,</hi> which in ſome Parts of the World do <hi>annually</hi> blow to help the Mariner forward in the purſuit of his gainful Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; or whether it ſhall only be like that <hi>bright Minute</hi> which Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers tell us of, that comes but <hi>once</hi> in the whole Compaſs of a Man's Life, and which if he lazily let ſlip, he ſhall never have ſuch another, but is doom'd to Miſery by a Fatal Neceſſity all the remainder of his Days?</p>

               <p>But the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Inſtitution is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly called the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.8, &amp;c.</note> as contra-diſtinguiſh'd from the Judaical one, tho' that alſo had God for its Author; ſo ſmall a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was given forth under the one, like little Drops of the <hi>Dew</hi> from Heaven which juſt wets the Ground; in Compariſon of what is beſtowed under the other, like a plentiful Shower of Rain from above that abundanly Waters it. It was in the <hi>New Creation</hi> as in the <hi>Old.</hi> The cold and dark <hi>Evening</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the warm and bright <hi>Morning;</hi> and God appointed the <hi>leſſer Light to Rule the Night,</hi> and the <hi>greater</hi> one to govern the Day.

               <p>Therefore our Bleſſed Saviour ſtiles himſelf the <hi>Light of the World;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 8.12.</note> a Title which he doth deſerve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Objects that he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us of; having ſet thoſe <hi>Old</hi> Truths which before were but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended, in a full and clear Light; and acquainted us with thoſe <hi>New</hi> ones, which had it not been for him, we had for ever remained Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of. And he doth deſerve it no leſs, becauſe of that Vital Influence with which his Heavenly Doctrine is accompanied; without which all Knowledge in our Minds would be but like decayed Drugs, which tho'
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:99901:117"/>taken into our Bodies, having loſt all their Virtue, never operate upon them; nay, Men could not act worſe, if they verily believed, or knew thoſe Doctrines to be falſe, than they do now they believe and know them to be true.
<note place="margin">Joh. 1.4. Epheſ. 5.14.</note> His <hi>Light is the Life</hi> of Men; <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the Dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light.</hi> And by the Scriptures we are certified, that God hath appointed his own Son to be his High Almoner to diſtribute this Royal Gift of his among us his needy Creatures. That being God and Man, he hath the Infinite Goodneſs of the one, and the tender Bowels of the other uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him. And he hath not only the Kindneſs of an Ordinary Man, but his Humane Nature was filled with a Spirit of Love and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and therefore he who hath ſo ſtrictly commanded us to deal forth

                  <hi>our Bread,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.10.</note> and draw out our Souls to the hungry,</hi> will be much more ready to do it himſelf. The Woman of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> tho' none of the beſt Temper or Character, who denied him a Draught of Common Water, might have had the Water of Life from him, if ſhe had but ſeriouſly <hi>asked</hi> it of him.
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note> And tho' the Hearts of his Country-men the <hi>Jews</hi> were full of Malice againſt him, yet from a Cuſtom that had obtained among them of bringing Water from <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loam</hi> to the Temple, and pouring it out there, he takes Occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to them that He was the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Saving-Grace, and gives them an Univerſal Invitation, ſaying, <hi>If any man,</hi> tho' he be never ſo poor,
<note place="margin">Joh. 7.37.</note> or hath been never ſo wicked, yet if he <hi>thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> And aſſures them that they ſhould not repair to him in vain. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> For he adds; <hi>He that believeth on me,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99901:118"/>as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water. This ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him ſhould receive,</hi> as St. <hi>John,</hi> the infallible Commentator, adds. And there are ſeveral Circumſtances of this Speech of his which the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt mentions, and are worthy of our Obſervation: <hi>In the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis the Feaſt of Tabernacles that is here meant, one of the three on which all the Males in <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to appear at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the Firſt and the Laſt Days whereof were <hi>Great</hi> Days, and in a Special manner to be obſerved as a holy Convocation, wherein it was not Lawful for them to follow their Worldly Employments. And conſequently this being a Day of Leiſure, there was the greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the People. And it being the <hi>Laſt</hi> Day, and they on the Point
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99901:118"/>of departing to their ſeveral Homes; juſt as they were going he utters theſe Words, that ſo they might ſtick and abide by them as mens laſt Speeches are wont to do. And then 'tis added that <hi>Jeſus ſtood up.</hi> The uſual way among the <hi>Jews</hi> was for thoſe who taught the People to do it <hi>Sitting;</hi> but here we find our Saviour choſe the other Poſture, that his Voice might reach the further. And he did not faintly Whiſper, but he <hi>Cried,</hi> that every one there might be ſure to hear him; and that by the Loudneſs and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of his Delivery he might make the greater Impreſſion upon their Souls. So earneſtly did he deſire to draw Men to him for their Spiritual Advantage.</p>
               <p>And as a <hi>Sanative Vertue</hi> was ſent forth from the Body of Chriſt here on Earth for the Curing the Natural Diſtempers of all thoſe who reſorted to him, and believed on him; ſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99901:119"/>ſhall Influences of Grace flow forth from him in Heaven for the healing the Spiritual Diſeaſes of thoſe who ſeek to him and depend upon him. He will do as great Miracles and Cures on Mens Souls, as ever he did on their Bodies. Open the Eyes of them who were Born blind: quicken them who are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their Feet to them that are Lame; cleanſe them that are Lepers, and caſt out the unclean Spirits from thoſe who have been poſſeſſed by them.</p>
               <p>And to remove all Jealouſies and Obſtructions, he hath given us ſuch a Deſcription of the Gracious Nature and Will of God, as is moſt worthy of him, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to incline us to return to him; to awaken the Negligent, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Doubting. He hath clearly inform'd us of his Holineſs, Juſtice and Omniſcience, as a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy againſt the vain and fatal Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99901:119"/>of thoſe who are ſecure in Sin, and are apt to fancy him like a <hi>drowzy</hi> Judge on the Bench, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hears nor regards how Cauſes go. He hath as fully diſplay'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the Riches of his Grace, that awaken'd Sinners might not deſpair, and ſo prove obſtinate and irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. It was the Reproach of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſ. 106.20.</note> that they <hi>changed the Glory of God into the Similitude of an Ox that eateth Graſs.</hi> 'Tis of a more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conſequence to transform him into the Likeneſs of a <hi>roaring Lion;</hi> thirſting after Mens Blood, and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour their Souls. Our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, in purſuance of his great Deſign, which is to recover Men from Sin, hath given us quite other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of him: That he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be at Peace, and ready to give forth of his Grace:
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.11, 12, 13.</note> That the moſt tender-hearted Father can't be half ſo ready to give Bread to his
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99901:120"/>Starving Child, as God is to give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him. And to cut off all Objections to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>viz.</hi> how can God conſiſtently with his Holineſs, Juſtice, and the Honour of his Government, beſtow ſo rich a Bleſſing on us? the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures further tell us, it was one End of his Death to purchaſe Saving-Grace for us. It was part of the Prize for which he ran, a Branch of that <hi>Joy that was ſet before him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to <hi>him to endure the Croſs, and deſpiſe the Shame,</hi> and Pain of it. He knew he ſhould have <hi>a Seed,</hi> and <hi>ſee the Travel of his Soul,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10, 11.</note> and be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> with the bleſſed Fruit thereof. And <hi>when he aſcended up on High,

<note place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note> and was <hi>exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to Iſrael, and Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> Yea, ſaith the Apoſtle to thoſe Men
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99901:120"/>whoſe Hands were yet reaking in the Blood of Chriſt, and who therefore, one would think, ſhould never have been applied unto; or if they had, of all Men living they ſhould have been the <hi>Laſt</hi> that ever ſhould have heard ſuch glad Tidings; yet on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Unto you Firſt,</hi> ſaith he,

               <p>I Cannot Conclude without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a little Reflection upon what has been ſaid. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. How ſhould we love, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and adhere to, the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Bleſſed Author of ſuch a Revelation! How are Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters eſteemed, who treat of Matters which are of very great Uſe and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Mankind, in the things of this Life; And what a Price do Men ſet upon thoſe Books, wherein Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are cleared up, and thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Inventions are contained. Now what is there of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as Pardon of Sin, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life, the Doctrine whereof is encumber'd with ſo many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are too hard for Natural Light and Reaſon; but are ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99901:122"/>plainly, and fully, Solved by the Holy Scriptures? How are Men pleaſed with an exact Deſcription of a Foreign Country, tho' they do not ſo much as dream of dwelling in it, nor have any thoughts or hopes of having ſo much as <hi>one Foot of Land</hi> there! How then ſhould we value the Goſpel, that gives us ſo full and plain an Account of the Heavenly Country, and how we may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of all the Glory of it! What an Eſteem have ingenious Men for a Book of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> that gives an Account of the orderly Motions of the Sun, Moon, and Stars! What an happy Invention is that of thoſe Glaſſes, whereby they diſcover ſome leſſer Bodies, which the naked and unaſſiſted Eye is not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; tho' thereby they have no more Benefit from their Light and Influence, than thoſe who are the moſt ignorant of theſe Affairs. How
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99901:122"/>ſhould we value the Sacred Oracles, which do diſcover the Heavenly State to us, which is not to be known by mere Reaſon; and how we may ſo order our own Motions, as to get above, and out-ſhine any of thoſe glorious Luminaries. Let us adhere to the Bible; for if once we give up that, we are off from our Center, we ſhall find nothing whereon our Soul can reſt, but ſhall be at our Wits-end. Methinks that Courtier ſpoke like a Man of Senſe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan King <hi>Edwin,</hi> whilſt he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether he had beſt to turn Chriſtian, or no, when he ſaid thus to him:
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Bede</hi>'s Eccleſ. Hiſt. Gentis Angl. l. 2. cap. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>The preſent Life of Man upon Earth, Sir, if compared with that Time which is to us unknown, ſeems to me to reſemble a little Sparrow; which, while your Majeſty was feaſting within with
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99901:123"/>your Royal Retinue in your warm Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, during the roaring of the bluſtering Winds, and the falling of great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Rain and Snow without, flew in at one Door, and preſently flew out at another. All the time it was in the Houſe, it was well ſhelter'd from Wind and Weather: but as ſoon as it got out into the cold Air, we were altogether as ignorant whither it went, as we were, whence it came. Thus we can give ſome Account of our Soul during its Abode in the Body, while it was houſed and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured therein: but where it was Before, and how it fares with it Afterwards, is to us altogether unknown. If therefore Paulinus</hi> (he was the Chriſtian Biſhop who laboured to Convert thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens) <hi>by his Preaching can certainly inform us herein, he deſerves, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to be followed.</hi> And the King, after he had heard <hi>Paulinus</hi>'s Sermon, ſpoke like an Underſtanding Man, when he ſaid, <hi>I have long ago been
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99901:123"/>convinced that the Idols we have Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped were meer Nothings; becauſe the more diligently I have ſought for the Truth in this way of Religion, ſo much the farther was I from finding it. But now I openly profeſs, that by this Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the way of obtaining Eternal Life and Happineſs is clearly laid before us.</hi> Whereupon he immediately gave Orders for the Demoliſhing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Temples and Altars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us take heed that we do not fall ſhort of Pardon and Heaven. Sad was the Caſe of that wicked and prophane Lord at <hi>Samaria,</hi> who bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſaw</hi> the great Plenty with his Eyes, but never taſted of it; he ſtood at the Gate to let in others, but was trampled to Death by the Multitude preſſing in upon him. Much worſe will be our Caſe, if we only hear of the great Proviſion which God has made for us in the other State,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99901:124"/>and never feed upon it, but be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down to Hell in the Crowd of our own unpardoned Sins. It is a double Miſery, to be drowned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of Shore; to miſs of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and of that Heaven, that are ſo plainly revealed, and of which we have heard ſo much, and ſo often.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us clear up our Right and Title to both of them. How long have we remained in Doubts and Fears? and ſhall we always continue in that uneaſy Poſture, like a Door on its Hinges, moving this way and that, but ſtill hanging in the ſame Place where it was many Years ago?</p>
               <p>To clear up our Right, 'tis neceſſary that the following Rules be obſerv'd.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Don't give Way to immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate <hi>Worldly Sorrow.</hi> If we be like a Carkaſs that lies under the Weight of that Earth which preſſes upon it,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99901:124"/>and never ſtirs Hand or Foot to help it ſelf: If we lie down under our Burdens, only mourning, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and indulging our ſelves in black and gloomy Thoughts; we can never expect that God ſhould help us; eſpecially, if we do worſe than this, if we ſinfully afflict our ſelves, we can't reaſonably hope that God ſhould comfort us, and raiſe up them who madly caſt or bow themſelves down. If with our own Hands we plunge the Dagger into our Breaſt, it would be a Miracle if we did not loſe our Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, faint, and feel a great deal of Pain. They that will chew upon nothing but <hi>Wormwood and Gall,</hi> and delight in rolling it up and down in their Mouths, are likely to walk in the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> of their Souls all their Days.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Watch againſt the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Bodily Melancholy.</hi> This na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99901:125"/>diſpoſes a Man to Fears and Jealouſies, is the black Root of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle but vexatious Scruples and perverſe Cavillings, and will make him <hi>refuſe to be comforted,</hi> tho' there be ever ſo great Reaſon for it. If a Stander-by convince him of ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Work of God on his Soul, and of his Right to Pardon and Eternal Life; yet as ſoon as he is gone, all is undone again: the Melancholy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian being like a <hi>faulty Watch,</hi> which may be wound up and go a little, while ones Hand is upon it; but no ſooner is that removed off, but it runs down in an Inſtant, and ſtands ſtill again. When ſuch meet with World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Croſſes, (from which none are exempted) it caſts them into deep Fits of Sorrow, which in a Serious Perſon preſently runs into dreadful and amazing Fears about his Soul, and the ſuppoſed miſerable and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn State thereof. As <hi>Peter,</hi> when
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99901:125"/>he was over-ſhadowed with a <hi>Bright Cloud;</hi> ſo any other of the Diſciples of Chriſt when cover'd with a <hi>Black</hi> one,
<note place="margin">Luke 9.33.</note> are apt to ſpeak <hi>they know not what,</hi> eſpecially againſt themſelves. All proper <hi>Natural Means</hi> therefore muſt be made uſe of to ſubdue and keep under this evil Humour, which is ſo great an Enemy to a Life both of Grace and Peace.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Be skilful, diligent, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in <hi>Examining</hi> and <hi>Obſerving your ſelves.</hi> We muſt diſtinctly know the Marks and Characters of thoſe that ſhall be pardoned and ſaved accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures. We muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how methodically to go to Work, to find whether they are in us or no. We muſt narrowly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the main drift of our Actions, and the ſecret Springs, Ends, and Principles, of all that we do; and deal by our own Hearts, as Learned Men by an Obſcure and Profound Author,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99901:126"/>or an ill-written and blotted Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, which they carefully read over again and again, with a very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and critical Eye, that they may rightly and thoroughly underſtand them. And unleſs we do this, we ſhall never be able to attain to any ſolid and ſtable Comfort.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Be much in the <hi>Exerciſe of Grace,</hi> and endeavour daily to <hi>grow</hi> in it. Grace in the Habit, is like Fire in the Flint or Steel; which is not diſcern'd, but by the Colliſion of one againſt the other with ſome Force and Strength; nor the good Principle in the Heart, but as it ſallies forth into vigorous and lively Exerciſe in the Life. Stir up the ſleepy Habit, blow up the Heavenly Spark into a bright Flame, and thine own Eyes ſhall ſee it, and thy own Soul ſhall feel the warmth of it, and thou wilt be no longer in perplexing Doubts concerning it.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:99901:126"/>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Be more exact and circumſpect in your Walk.</p>
               <p>Bring Matters to <hi>an Head,</hi> ſee what it is, that is the Cauſe of your Jealouſies and Fears, ſome Sin of Omiſſion or Commiſſion; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Root, as ever you would have no more of this bitter Fruit. If you do theſe things you ſhall no longer ſuffer any dark Eclipſes; or if you ſhould, they will be but ſhort ones, and you will preſently emerge out of them; you will live in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and die in Peace. You will have no Temptation to cleave to this World, when God calls you away; like <hi>green Fruit,</hi> that <hi>ſticks</hi> to that Tree whereon it grows, and muſt be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently plucked and torn thence: But you will depart with great Freedom and Willingneſs, be like <hi>Ripe Fruit,</hi> that preſently and eaſily
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99901:127"/>Drops from the Tree whereon it does but looſely hang: And <hi>an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance will be adminiſtred to you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour.</hi>

For when he comes to prove the Major Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his firſt Syllogiſm, which is an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> and which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of <hi>Art,</hi> ſhould be the Concluſion of the ſecond; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, he ſubſtitutes a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:99901:128"/>and beſides, he ſhuffles that which was the <hi>Subject</hi> in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into the room of the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the Latter. For this is the <hi>Major</hi> of the firſt Syllogiſm.

               <hi>That Rule which is neceſſary for our Future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ought to be generally made known to all.</hi> And this is the Concluſion of the ſecond Syllogiſm, whereby he proves it, <hi>viz. Therefore that Rule which is not generally known, cannot be the Rule of our Happineſs.</hi> So that I ſuppoſe his <hi>Religion,</hi> and his <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> are of apiece, both <hi>meerly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which he would be at, is this, That <hi>no Revealed Religion has been</hi> (any, he is ſo very bold, as to ſay it <hi>never could be</hi>) <hi>made known to all Men, as it certainly would have been, if it were neceſſary to Future Happineſs; elſe there is no viſible means for the greater

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak more largely to this Point than is neceſſary for a ſufficient Anſwer to the Objection. Partly, becauſe I will endeavour to reconcile the Minds of Men in ſome meaſure to this hard Problem of not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to ſo great a Part of Mankind: Partly becauſe I am not altogether without Hopes, that it will fare with <hi>A.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99901:129"/>by his own Default: God therefore is not juſtly chargeable, if he ſhould leave all Mankind in their Deſerved and Self-procured Miſery, and never have ſet on foot in any Place of the World a Deſign of ſaving any Man. This is not a Matter of <hi>Right,</hi> which fallen Man can challenge as due to him; it may be with-held without any Wrong or Cruelty, becauſe 'tis a Matter of pure Arbitrary undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Revealed Religion, which is generally neceſſary to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing everlaſting Happineſs, and which he ſays NEVER COULD, I ſay both <hi>could</hi> and <hi>would</hi> have been univerſally known, had it not been for the groſs <hi>Negligence, Wickedneſs,</hi> and <hi>Malice of Men themſelves.</hi> For God preached it to <hi>Adam</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Fall; as alſo to <hi>Noah,</hi> the two Common Parents of all Mankind. <hi>Adam</hi> had the Goſpel in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99901:130"/>
               <hi>Miniature,</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpent's Head.</hi> And we have great Reaſon to believe, that what was wrapt up in theſe very General Terms, was more particularly unfolded to him, than it is here recorded. For it is evident, That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtudies Brevity, and gives an Hiſtorical Account of a great many Ages and Events, within the narrow Compaſs of a few Pages. And there was the leſs need that he ſhould in <hi>this place</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dilate upon the <hi>Meſſiab,</hi> a ſhort Hint was enough, becauſe that was the Subject which he was more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to open in his following Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
            <p>And it is highly probable, That our firſt Parents did underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which is the Marrow and Subſtance, the Sum and Center of the Goſpel, and the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Stone
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99901:130"/>of all our Hopes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation. This may be ſtrongly inferr'd from <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice, and God's Acceptance of it. The cutting in pieces of God's good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in whoſe Make and Frame there are ſo many Prints of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power and Wiſdom; the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their Blood, the burning of their Fat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This cannot be accounted for as a Reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but only as it ſerved to keep up in Mens minds a Senſe of the heinous Nature and Deſert of Sin; of the Juſtice of God, who would not Pardon without a Sacrifice, and yet of his Mercy at the ſame time, which was a Foundation of Hope to the Sinner, in as much as he would accept the Life of a Beaſt in lieu of the Offender; but principally as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were Types and Figures of the Death of the <hi>Promiſed Seed,</hi> who in due time was to put away Sin by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99901:131"/>the offering of himſelf. This Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom was ſpread over all the World; and it cannot be imagined how All Men, in all Ages, and in all Places, ſhould have agreed upon this as a principal Part of Divine Worſhip; but only that it deſcended to them by Tradition from the firſt Father of Mankind. But how inexcuſable was it in them to receive the Shell, and drop the Kernel; to retain the outward Rite and Sign, but loſe the great Thing ſignified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; without which the outward Act looks like a Barbarous one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of God to accept, and of Man to offer; ſo that he that made the Oblation, ſeemed to be as brutiſh as the very <hi>Beaſt</hi> that he ſlew?</p>
            <p>And no doubt but <hi>Adam,</hi> and other Holy Men, did communicate what Knowledge they had of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to their Children, as they in
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99901:131"/>all Reaſon ſhould have done to thoſe that were deſcended from them. <hi>Noah</hi> is expreſly called a <hi>Preacher of Righteouſneſs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.5.</note> And did he warn the World of the <hi>Flood,</hi> and can any one think he would ſpeak nothing of the Promiſed <hi>Seed? Enoch</hi> ſpake of <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jude 5.14.</note> and of his appearing to the Deſtruction of the Wicked; and no doubt but he ſpake alſo of his firſt and ſecond Appearing for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Righteous. <hi>Zacharias</hi> tells us, That God ſpake of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer <hi>by the Mouth of his Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which have been ſince the World began.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 1.70.</note> And if they were Good Men, they muſt needs ſpeak, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to their <hi>own Families,</hi> concerning him.</p>
            <p>And ſo much of the Doctrine concerning Chriſt, as was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary <hi>in thoſe Days,</hi> lay within a very narrow Room, <hi>viz. That Man was in a fallen State,</hi> and this they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99901:132"/>could not but know and feel: And that <hi>God had promiſed to reſcue them from it by ſome Extraordinary Perſon, who ſhould be ſent to this purpoſe in due time; and all that truſted in him, and through him returned to God and their Duty, ſhould be pardoned,</hi> and <hi>ſaved by him.</hi> And was this ſuch a <hi>Load</hi> to their Memories? Is a <hi>Jewel</hi> a Burden to a Man that carries it about him? Does the pained Man feel the Smart of his Wound, and forget the Healing-plaiſter; eſpecially when the Blood is trickling down every Day, and there is not a long Parentheſis between the Returns of his ſharp Fits, at the diſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, but he has a continual Monitor of it, as they had of their Miſery and need of a Remedy? Was it an unreaſonable <hi>hard</hi> Task for the Father to teach, or the Son to learn ſo Short a Leſſon as this is; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that then the Life
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99901:132"/>of Man was not ſhut up in ſuch narrow Limits, as now it is? The Cloth is now <hi>ſhrunk</hi> up to Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years and Ten, but then it was ſtretched out to ſeveral Hundreds: A very fair time ſure, for both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Scholar. A Learned
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>William</hi>'s 2d Serm. of <hi>Revel.</hi> p. 8, 9.</note> Man has well obſerved, That the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity of thoſe Patriarchs, with whom this Leſſon was depoſited, and who were to take care that it might be preſerved inviolable, was a very great Advantage: For three of them alone filled up the firſt Period of 1656 Years, from the Creation to the Flood, <hi>viz. Adam, Methuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> and <hi>Noah.</hi> And Four of the Fathers after the Flood, tho' the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Lives was then ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fell in with the 856 Years from the Flood, to the giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and in him we have freſh
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99901:133"/>Information about the Promiſed Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</p>
            <p>But if their Days had been much Shorter, and the Leſſon much Harder and Longer; yet it ſhould have been ſtudied with the greateſt Application of Mind, as is uſual in all Arts and Sciences, which are of an infinitely Inferior Nature. <hi>They</hi> tend to a Mans comfortable living in this World; But the Doctrine of the Promiſed Meſſiah, was what their Eternal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare was wrapt up in; And ſo was that of their Children too. And therefore conſidering that Love to Themſelves, and to their Poſterity, which is ſo very deeply engraven on the Souls of Men; ſuch a Doctrine ſhould have been diligently and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately taught, readily learned, fixedly retained, and carefully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted down from Age to Age; they ſhould ſooner have forgotten their <hi>own Names,</hi> than have forgotten that.

But if this Man had by his own Wickedneſs contracted, and then tranſmitted that Diſeaſe to his Children, and knew it would run down from him in a Blood to his Childrens Children to the End of the World; if yet he had not revealed ſo rare a Secret to his own Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, that they might be freed from
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:99901:134"/>that racking Torment in this World, which he had brought upon them; ſuch wretched ill Nature did deſerve to be puniſhed with Everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the other State.</p>
            <p>All this being conſidered, one would think it were Impoſſible but that the Subſtance of Revealed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſhould have been tranſmitted, and a ſufficient Knowledge of it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed every-where, and been propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated together with the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And ſo it would, had it not been for moſt inexcuſable Negligence and Perverſneſs, moſt amazing Folly and Madneſs. God has not been wanting to Men, but Men have been moſt unaccountably wanting to Themſelves and their Children. Now by what Law is God obliged, in a miraculous Manner, to reſtore a fair Eſtate to a Family, when one was ſetled upon it, and has been very wickedly and fooliſhly embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled?
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99901:134"/>Or to make Corn ſpring out of the Earth, when Men refuſe to Plow their Ground, and throw away their Seed?</p>
            <p>But leaſt of all, could this have been reaſonably expected, either by the Men of the Old, or thoſe of the New World. For they loſt not only the Notices of the Promiſed Seed, but even of God himſelf; and dropt the plain Principles of Common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, as well as thoſe of Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Whether Idolatry, that abſurd and ſottiſh Practice, began before the Flood, is not ſo very certain; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis plain that the whole Earth was covered with Debauchery and Violence, <hi>all fleſh having corrupted their way;</hi> whereon God reſolved to ſweep them all away at once, eight Perſons only excepted, to people it again with a better Race. But when they had ſtocked it, Wickedneſs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God's <hi>Curſe,</hi> ſo lately
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99901:135"/>and ſo viſibly attending it, grew very <hi>fruitful, increaſed and multiplied</hi> as faſt as Mankind did; And that vile Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and abominable Immorality, into the Dregs whereof they ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſunk, provoked God to abandon them in a fearful manner, as the Apoſtle excellently diſcourſes in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi> And it was a Righteous thing in him to do it. Nor can there be any juſt Grounds to reflect on him for not ſetting on foot a new divine Revelation, which they had wilfully and carefully loſt; when beſides that, they ſo abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſinned againſt the Common Light of Nature and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>However at length,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> in infinite Mercy, and undeſerved Compaſſion, God did once again cauſe the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light to ſhine into one little Apartment of the Houſe of this World; whence it ſhould, and might have
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:99901:135"/>been tranſmitted and reflected into every Room thereof. For he renews the Promiſe of a <hi>Seed in which all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed,</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Children, who were Conſiderable Men, and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Travellers, and in very Great Eſteem with ſome Kings: And no doubt but theſe Holy Men were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to inſtruct them and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in this main Point, had they been but willing to learn.</p>
            <p>After this God brings the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed like the Stars of Heaven, and like thoſe in the <hi>Galaxy,</hi> gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a Body, that ſo mingling their Lights, and ſhining with united Rays, they might be the more viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; maintains them in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, plants and preſerves them in <hi>Canaan</hi> by a Train of mighty Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, tho' he could have done it with leſs Noiſe, to awaken the Neighbour
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99901:136"/>Nations to come and join with them. For when he choſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> he was far from excluding thereby the Reſt of Mankind from the Hopes and Means of Salvation. As the Apoſtle argues concerning the <hi>Way</hi> of Salvation by Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.17.</note> ſo may we concerning the deſigned <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> thereof: <hi>The Law which was Four hundred and thirty Years after,</hi> could not, in God's Intention, <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul the Promiſe, that in Abraham's Seed All the NATIONS of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed, ſo as to make it of no Effect. Was the Law</hi> given the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai, againſt this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? God forbid.</hi> So far was it from this, that 'tis ſuppoſed in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Heathens would turn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, and Proviſion in that caſe was made for their Encouragement. Their Law indeed was a <hi>Partition-Wall;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2.14.</note> but it was ſo to keep the Jews <hi>in,</hi> not in <hi>God's</hi> Deſign, whatever it
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99901:136"/>might be in <hi>theirs,</hi> to keep the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles <hi>out:</hi> And therefore in this Wall there was ſtill a <hi>Door</hi> kept open for their Entrance; and that no more came in, is to be aſcribed partly to the Wickedneſs of the Jew, and partly to that of the Gentile.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Perſon of great Renown in the Eaſt, among the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans.</hi> Several great Nations, particularly the <hi>Saracens,</hi> (for they themſelves ſcorn'd to be called <hi>Hagarens</hi>) deſcended from him, and valued themſelves upon it; and they were very formidable to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, had a vaſt one of their own in the Eaſt, and puſh'd their Conqueſts Weſtward as far as <hi>Spain</hi> it Self.

<note n="*" place="bottom">Id. p. 206.</note> 
               <hi>If our Happineſs depend upon our Belief, we cannot firmly believe till our Reaſon be convinced of a Supernatural Religion. And if the Reaſons of it were Evident, there could be no longer any Contention about Religion: All Men would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſame, and acquieſce in it. No Prejudice would prevail againſt the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a Future Good. 'Tis every
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99901:140"/>Man's greateſt Buſineſs here to labour for his Happineſs, and conſequently none would be backward to know the Means.— And if I cannot believe, 'tis a Sign the Evidence is not ſtrong enough to make me.</hi> And a little before, ſaith
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 202.</note> he, <hi>We</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> We Deiſts, for I think that is the true meaning of the Paſſage, tho' it be brought in as ſpoken by an Objector; We) <hi>ſay, that Religion is only true, which is or may be reaſonable and convincing to all Men: Now if it be not Generally held, it appears not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing.</hi> Hereby he hath highly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the <hi>Atheiſtical Crew,</hi> and given them an Argument to overturn the Foundations of the Deiſts Natural Religion. For they may ſay, <hi>If the Reaſons of it were Evident, there could be no longer any Contention</hi> about the Being of a God, or a Future State. <hi>And if I cannot believe either of theſe,</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:99901:141"/>(as ſaith the Atheiſt I cannot) <hi>'tis a ſign the Evidence is not ſtrong enough to make me.</hi> Nay, as a <hi>foul Gun</hi> recoils and wounds him that ſhoots with it, ſo doth this way of Arguing return upon our Deiſts. For there are Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes that do believe Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is not ſufficient for the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men, eſpecially of thoſe who have a Revealed one propoſed to them, but denied by 'em. 'Tis ſo evident, that this may be retorted upon themſelves, that our Author obſerves it, and makes this <hi>modeſt</hi> Reply to it,
<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 202, 203.</note> That <hi>there are but few of a Nation that ever conſider to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Religion;</hi> which we muſt be ſo civil as to ſuppoſe the <hi>Immortal</hi> Deiſt to do. <hi>But 'tis evident that many Men in all Religions at this day have center'd in the Opinion of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and its Sufficiency of</hi> (I ſuppoſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99901:141"/>it ſhould be <hi>for</hi>) <hi>Happineſs.</hi> But no Chriſtian doth or can think ſo, as long as theſe Words are in the Bible, <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> and <hi>except ye believe that I am He, ye ſhall die in your Sins.</hi> And Reaſon will tell us, if Scripture had been ſilent, that thoſe Men muſt periſh that prophanely treat the Son of God as an Impoſtor, and his Religion as a <hi>Lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, according to this way of arguing, hardly any thing can be <hi>either True or Falſe,</hi> whereas every thing muſt be <hi>either one or t'other.</hi> Let us take for an Inſtance the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation. If the Reaſons of it were evident, there could be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger any Contention about it. All Men would embrace it, and acquieſce in it. If it be not Generally held, it appears not convincing. If I cannot believe it,</hi> (and all Proteſtants, the Heathens, and ſome of the Papiſts themſelves
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:99901:142"/>tell us they can't believe it) <hi>'tis a Sign the Evidence is not ſtrong enough to make me.</hi> Therefore the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation is not true. And by the ſame way of arguing, I will prove it is not <hi>Falſe neither. For if the Reaſons</hi> againſt it <hi>were evident, there could be no longer any Contention about it;</hi> but all the World would preſently turn good <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in this Fundamental Point. <hi>And if I cannot believe it</hi> to be Falſe, ſaith the Papiſt, <hi>'tis a Sign the Evidence is not ſtrong enough to make me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Reaſon why Men do not believe the Goſpel, is not the want of <hi>External Evidence,</hi> but <hi>Internal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition;</hi> which latter is as neceſſary as the former. We have <hi>Motives</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſway a wiſe and pious Man to embrace Chriſtianity; but God hath not given us ſuch a <hi>glaring Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of the Truth of it, as we have that <hi>two and two make four.</hi> If he
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99901:142"/>had, Aſſenting to it would be no Proof of any Man's Ingenuity, there would be nothing Praiſe-worthy in it. A <hi>Deiſt</hi> may be proud and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, mad upon his Luſts, and therefore Unwilling the Goſpel ſhould be true; he may not duly weigh the Arguments which are brought for the Confirmation of it; nor earneſtly and honeſtly pray for God's Aſſiſtance to diſcern aright; nor be true to that Light which he already enjoys; and for theſe Reaſons God in his Righteous Judgment may leave him to the Devil and Himſelf, and then he cannot believe; but for all that he ſhall Eternally periſh, and that very juſtly too, in and for his Infidelity.</p>
            <p>And this Gentelman muſt be a great Stranger to Humane Nature and the Courſe of the World, who ſaith, <hi>No Prejudice would prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Certainty of a Future Good:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99901:143"/>'Tis every Man's greateſt Buſineſs here to labour for his Happineſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently none WOULD be backward to know the means;</hi> which the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Ages doth evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute. In ſhort, beſides Evidence and Argument, there is required a <hi>pious Temper</hi> of Soul, lying open to, and eaſily impreſſible by Divine Truths; and one of ſuch a Make would quickly cloſe with, and firmly adhere to Chriſtianity; as a prepared Soil eaſily takes in, and firmly retains ſuch a ſort of good Grain as is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it.</p>
            <p>I would not have this Gentleman deceive himſelf with vain Hopes,

<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 200.</note> that what Sir <hi>C.

Theſe ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations were indeed all but</hi> Symbolical, <hi>and referr'd to our Sorrow and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; That is the true and</hi> only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation <hi>of Sin, and is ſo agreed upon
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99901:144"/>by all Men in all Ages, and of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, wherefore take it for an Undoubted Truth.</hi> For my part, I cannot but take it for an <hi>undoubted Falſhood,</hi> and groſs Miſtake. I grant that they thought <hi>Repentance</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Outram de Sacrif. p. 168.</note> as well as <hi>Prayer</hi> ought to accompany their Sacrifices. But he that ſays all their Sacrifices were only <hi>Symbolical</hi> of Repentance, and that it was ſo in the Senſe of all Ages, and all Religions, ſays he knows not what. 'Twas not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews.</hi> They offer'd Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to make <hi>Atonement</hi> for their Sins, and an <hi>Expiation</hi> of them; and they judged that their Sins were imputed to the Beaſt, who thereupon was killed, that by its ſuffering Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their ſtead, they might be releaſed, and God be reconcil'd to them.</p>
            <pb n="248" facs="tcp:99901:145"/>
            <p>But the <hi>ſmell</hi> of a <hi>Jew,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Bible,</hi> is offenſive to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; and therefore let us go to the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations, which will be more ſuitable to him. They ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack'd the whole Earth, Air, and Water, for Oblations to their Gods. Some think <hi>Swine</hi> were the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ones. But 'tis more
<note n="*" place="bottom">Owen <hi>Exerc. on</hi> Heb. Vol. 1. p. 310.</note> likely that the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the Earth were ſo; Herbs and Plants
<note n="†" place="bottom">Potter<hi>'s Antiq. of</hi> Greece. p. 188.</note> they plucked up by the Roots, and burnt them with their Leaves and Fruit. And the <hi>Gods</hi> fed as well as the Men; for this was before Fleſh was eaten.

            <p>Their Folly did not ſtop here, but turn'd into downright Frenzy; for they butcher'd Men, Women, and Children; their beſt Friends and neareſt Relations, and burnt them on their Altars. <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Porphyry,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c. tell us this was a moſt Univerſal Cuſtom.

            </p>
            <p>I'le add but one more, (tho' I could produce ſeveral others): The Deiſt ſometimes bears up very brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about <hi>Repentance, 'Tis the true and only Expiation of Sin, and is ſo agreed upon by all Men, in all Ages, and of all Religions; wherefore take it for an
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 200.</note> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth; and this not revealed, but innate, and a part of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Sure by his Confidence he looks on this as <hi>Full Payment.</hi> And yet a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99901:153"/>little after, 'tis but a <hi>little part</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition-Money,</hi> but 'tis all we have. <hi>Repentance is what we can anſwer
<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 209.</note> to an Atonement, and therefore we may reaſonably aſſert 'tis all God will expect from us.</hi> 'Tis but as a <hi>Thouſand Pounds</hi> when a Man owes a <hi>Million,</hi> and the <hi>Creditor can have but All.</hi> And as pert as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is, yet ſometime his Heart fails him. For the higheſt he can go is but <hi>Vero-ſimile eſt, ſimilem Deo à Deo
<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 90.</note> non negligi. 'Tis likely that he who is like God, is not neglected of God: Not to be Neglected of God,</hi> is but a very <hi>faint</hi> Expreſſion. A Man may be <hi>not neglected</hi> of God, and yet be but in very low Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
